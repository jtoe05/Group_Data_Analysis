The feeling of a cycle quiet way already happens in some small pockets in NYC, those that have winding streets or dead ends nearby. 

An interesting example of a model that could be used to replicate this is the closed street in the 90s on the east side. I forget the specific street, but it's a crosstown lane closed to traffic for one block. With this small closure, the rest of the street is naturally quieter because it's not used for through traffic.
