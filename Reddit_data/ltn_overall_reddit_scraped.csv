comment,,2020-09-12 16:37:51,"Agreed. It might be poorly executed and ill thought out but no amount of public consultation will change the fact that this is something that needs to happen. The idea isn't to make a small number of arterial roads jam packed with cars - the idea is to make a small number of arterial roads so jam packed with cars that people wake up and go 'fuck this, I'm not using my car'. Every protester I saw today was talking about care workers and disabled access, as though this is the critical argument that must be considered in combatting climate change...

Roads to every front door cannot remain the norm.

comment,,2020-09-12 18:18:18,"It bothers me when people who couldn’t give less of a shit about disabled people use us as a reason to oppose sensible changes. I’m a wheelchair user and while I can’t speak for all disabled people (as many do need to use a car to get from a-b for a large variety of reasons), life is better for me when public transport is abundant and efficient. For a lot of people who can’t use public transport, it’s because it’s not accessible. If I need a car to get between home and wherever I’m going it’s cos there’s no lift at the station or the buses won’t put the ramp out. So it’s a straw man argument to suggest that low traffic neighbourhoods are discriminatory against vulnerable people, because jam packed roads make it really hard for disabled people to get around too. 

If they cared that much they’d be campaigning for a better welfare state or improved access or literally ANYTHING more relevant to our lives.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/ird6cy/march_in_northfields_to_protest_the_setup_of_new/g4xyfhh/,,March in Northfields to protest the setup of new LTN (Low Traffic Neighbourhood) without public consultation

Sure, an uninjured, youthful body wouldn't notice, but when you break your leg or are pushing through chemo treatments or are helping a friend with mobility issues, it's good to have accessible transport even for people who wouldn't consider themselves to have a physical disability.

it's just good social practice to make everything as accessible as possible.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/ird6cy/march_in_northfields_to_protest_the_setup_of_new/g4z19i0/,,March in Northfields to protest the setup of new LTN (Low Traffic Neighbourhood) without public consultation
comment,,2020-09-13 11:41:56,"Exactly. I lived in the Netherlands for a while and it was really noticeable and pleasing to see how the cycle infrastructure also benefited wheelchair users - lots of people bombing along on those setups with handcranks. No need to worry about paths suddenly ending or big curb stones to negotiate, and of course most bridges either have a low gradient slope or a lift to get on or off. I'm sure there are still some issues there but it's really not that hard to significantly improve our urban areas for all users!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/ird6cy/march_in_northfields_to_protest_the_setup_of_new/g52vl4k/,,March in Northfields to protest the setup of new LTN (Low Traffic Neighbourhood) without public consultation

comment,,2020-10-22 16:39:20,"Well I had a look at some recent studies and they don't support the claim that LTN's decrease overall traffic use on surrounding roads, mainly because they didn't study it (??? very strange, is that because it might make the scheme look bad? I hope not but suspicious imo).

There's evidence that people self report cycling and walking more, but it doesn't seem to be massively statistically pronounced.

I may have sounded like I am against any and all traffic reduction schemes, but this is not the case. I do think it's a good idea, but I think if you're going to direct all traffic down a main road away from rat runs then you should also consider adding an extra lane to that road or other upgrades.

I don't think simply increasing journey times is a very good strategy, I think it should be attacked the other way by making it easier to use other forms of travel and just mainly leaving the car the fuck alone. 

Now I know London is a bit different, most of my thinking is how these kind of schemes have been implemented where I live, they have closed several key bridges to prevent 'rat runs' and it has made the traffic worse on the main roads, no doubt about it.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/jfvcru/despite_a_loud_opposing_minority_lowtraffic/g9ng6ul/,,"Despite a loud opposing minority, low-traffic neighbourhoods are increasingly popular.

There's so many flaws in the system it would take me a long time to type them out here, but one is that you only have to let people know about the consultation in the area you're consulting on, so something that would benefit the area at large would always be objected to.

post,"I've been reluctant to tell my story, but maybe now is the time.",2023-08-01 00:03:03,"I've always been reluctant to post about my experience because it's unsettling and it freaks me out to this day. With the recent whilstelblowers coming out, maybe it would be beneficial for me to share my experience, observations and evidence. Word of warning though: things get more and more 'woo' as the story unfolds.

On the 12th of January 2008, I was staying in the spare bedroom of my Dad's house in the Mossley Hill area of Liverpool, UK. I was 18 at the time, and my dad was 43. I went to sleep at about 11:00pm. Just after midnight, my dad comes into my bedroom to wake me up, and he insists that I join him in the main bedroom at the front of the house to look at something.

I was reluctant to get up, but he insisted. From the upstairs front bedroom, we then watched approximately 100-200 glowing 'orbs' silently moving over our neighbourhood for what seemed to be at least 10 minutes.

The objects looked like balls of plasma, roughly 15-30 feet in diameter. To the naked eye, the colours were primarily orange and red, however they would sometimes change colour and appear green or purple. They were moving at low altitude; 50-100 feet above the neighbouring houses. The objects appeared to move in a line formation, with very precise motion. Objects in the formation appeared to follow each other in a straight line, however the motion was staggered, meaning one object would go from being completely stationary, and then it would instantaneously transition to what I'd say was about 40mph in order to catch up with the next object in the formation. 

We stood in place for about 10 minutes, and then my dad said he was going to go downstairs and get the cameras. He told me to stay in the bedroom because he feared for my safety. I continued to watch the objects alone for a further few minutes before presumably going back into my bedroom and falling asleep. I dont have any memory of going back into my bedroom to sleep that night. It's unsettling to think that it could be missing time, however it could just be because I was groggy having been fast asleep just 15 minutes beforehand.

The next morning, I spoke to my dad about what happened with him.

He told me that he went downatsairs into the kitchen and picked up one of our two Olympus 2mp digital cameras. These cameras were usually kept inside of our waterproof dive housings, as they were the cameras that we'd take scuba diving - we've both used the cameras thousands of times at depths below 20 metres, and never had an issue with them.

He said he went into the back garden, and the objects were low enough and bright enough to illuminate the garden. One detail he mentioned, was that everything felt incredibly silent and still - there was no wind noise, insect noise, and no car or traffic noise. I cant remember his exact quote, but he said it felt like being in a 'separate bubble of reality'. 

He then tried to take photographs of the objects directly above our house, however the camera behaved in an unusual way that we've never seen before or since. The first few images registered as pure black, with essentially no pixel data. He then tried switching to video mode, however the video refused to start recording. He tried again, and eventually managed to start the recording process, however the video file would not playback - we get a 'picture error' message on the camera display when trying to play it, which indicates that the SD card was somehow corrupted. He went back to photo mode, and eventually managed to get some images that remained on the device, however even these images are quite strange;

The objects in the photographs appear 'blue shifted', meaning that they appear blue/green whereas to the naked eye they appeared red/ orange. Even more strangely, some of the objects that were occluded from view (ie, they were obscured by the house) were later found to be visible in the images. This means that light from the objects was able to pass through the solid house and register on the device and create an impression on the camera sensor. Note, these occluded objects appear much more diffuse and 'fuzzy' compared to the ones that weren't occluded.

In terms of the images, we still have the original SD cards stored safely in case they're needed for analysis - they're untouched from that night. In terms of the digital images that actually registered, unfortunately I can only share the cropped versions that my dad put together afterwards, you can find them here: https://imgur.com/gallery/KpQz26k

I recognise that these images arent the most convincing evidence for others, however I believe they're important because having some sort of sensor data at least confirms to me personally that something actually happened, and it wasnt just a shared hallucination.

In terms of follow up, things get pretty wierd and I'm not 100% if I've got the timeline correct. 

My dad contacted the local media and police to see if anybody else reported anything, which they hadn't. It's worth noting that there would've been hudreds of people leaving pubs and bars nearby at this time of night at the weekend, so the fact that nobdy else witnessed hundreds of orbs flying overhead is very strange. I'm not certain, but I think my dada also reffered the case to MUFON. 

For me personally at that time, I was undergoing flight training at Liverpool Flying School, and I was unsure if this should be reported the CAA as a flight hazard. My instructors changed each week, but my favouirite one happened to be an oldschool ex-RAF pilot with a big moustache and leather flight gloves. I dont want to Dox him, but I'm sure it'd be possible to find his details if necessary. Anyway, after my next lesson I confided in him and told him what happened. He advised me not to report it, and then he started telling me of his own experience which he'd also refused to officially report. I wont butcher his story here, but long story short, he said he was flying military jets over the lake district in th 80s when he was tasked with investigating a large radar signature that was miles wide. He ended up witnessing a gigantic 'see through' disk shaped object that flipped on it's side and shot up into space. Frightening! 

I wish this was the end of the story, but unfortunately not.

For the next 6 months we had numerous follow up sightings in the same location. I was present for two of them, but there were at least 5 other occassions according to my dad. These sightings were different to the original however - they all took place in daylight, and the objects were the typical spherical silver/white objects at very high altitude - the ones that always get dismissed as baloons.

We didnt seem to have any technicial malfunctions when taking images of these craft, however it was very difficult to get enough  zoom with the cameras to see them. Funnilly enough, we decided to purchase a big reflector telescope to go in the garden for this very purpose and that's when they stopped showing up!

In terms of these follow up sightings, on at least one occassion a neighbour confirmed that he could see it as well when it remained in place for a full 8 hours.  In terms of their behavior, these white spheres would materialse and dematerialse from nowhere. They seem to quickly shrink in size, or grow in size from nothing - very similar to this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzZLm38Dacs

One behaviour we noticed, was that these spheres would sometimes multiply in number and then move into each other without self intersecting, almost as if they could overlap each other in 3D space. In terms of motion, these objects would remain completely stationary in the wind, or move in a strangely linear manner that seemed a bit jarring.

Here's a pretty uninspring video my dad took during one of these follow up sightings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_38MgYxsQ0&amp;t=1s

As you can imagine, the experiences were starting to have quite a proufound affect on me, and I fell 'down the rabbit hole'. Things started to get very 'woo' at this point:

I essentially dropped out of sixth form and became obsessed with theoretical physics. During this time, I would still go into school to speak privately with my physics teacher, and I started to develop my own ideas about the nature of spacetime. My professor somehow organised for me to privately meet with some folks in the physics department at the Univeristy of Liverpool, which I agreed to. This was a pretty odd experience in itself, beacsue I wasn't there for an interview or university application - it seemed like these reserachers just wanted to probe my ideas and then guide me in a certain direction.

Again, I'm not going to Dox the contacts who 'interviewed' me, but here's a brief summary of their research fields:

- Fundamental symmetries foundational to physics, in particular a group structure relating the fundamental parameters space, time, mass and charge.

- A universal rewrite system derived from the concept zero.

- A nilpotent version of relativistic quantum mechanics, with significant applications in particle physics and cosmology.

- Fundamental mathematical structures relating to physics and biology

- Application of rewrite concept to analysis of large-scale systems in physics, biology, theoretical computing

So at this point, both my Dad and I are searching for answers in different places - I was more interested in the technical theories regarding spacetime, whereas my dad was more interested in the human conspiracy side of things. He asked me to join him at a UFO conference that took place in Liverpool a few months after our experiences. It's difficult to find information about this event online, but I can say that the event took place in the Static gallery on Roscoe street, and Nick Pope was there along with some of the witnesses from the Rendalsham forrest incident.

There was a short intermission during the event, and I went outisde with a few of the attendees who were having a smoke break before the next speaker. I was in full flow describing my space time theory to a stranger and they started calling us back inside - at this point I looked up and saw a small red/orange orb in the distance. At first I thought it was a lantern, however it then started to move very erraticly backwards and forwards tracing out the shape of a large sine wave in the sky - exactly what I was trying to describe to the person I was talking to. We both watched it for a minute, then I suggested we should shout into the building to let all the UFO guys come and take a look - we had all the experts in the building right next to us! I know this sounds unbelieveable, but the stranger told me ""it's a message for you"", and then he left.

At this point I'm freaking out and I go inside - almost having a panic attack. This nice hippy guy then sits me down in the lobby and shows me a breath exercise to help calm down. Later that night as we're leaving the conference, the same guy hands me a hand printed booklet on hermetic psi exercises, which I've now unfortunately lost and cannot find anywhere online. I did spend a few months attempting the exercises in the booklet however it gave me severe, terrifying sleep paralyisis and very vivid, frightening dreams. This, combined with unsettling nature of the other encounters mentioned above was enough to scare me away from the subject in general.

For the last 14 I've just lived a normal life as a 3d rendering artist - I try my best to avoid the subject of UFOs, theoretical physics, and all the 'woo' that's associated with it. I know it's real, and I know it's important, but it's also terrifying for reasons that I still cant fully explain. Hopefully the post I've written here will be enough to allow someone braver/more intelligent than myself to investigate and come up with some answers.

post,London’s low-traffic zones ‘cut deaths and injuries by more than a third’,2025-07-07 20:34:42,"Low-traffic neighbourhoods cut road injuries and deaths by more than a third within their boundaries with no apparent negative safety effect on nearby roads, a study has shown.

Based on comparisons of more than a decade of road casualty statistics between 113 London LTNs and other roads that did not have them, the report’s authors found that LTNs were associated with a 35% reduction in all injuries, rising to 37% for deaths and serious injuries.

In absolute terms, the study concluded, this meant that creating the LTNs prevented more than 600 road injuries that would have otherwise taken place, including 100 involving death or serious injury.

My own council in London did their consultation on parking permits on my road incorrectly. Instead of doubling down and forcing it through, they repeated the consultation so did it correctly the second time. The result was the same. It probably helped that a councillor lived off the road so knew some of the residents who wouldn't hesitate to take the council to court.


I recently had an issue with another London council. It's gone on for a few years. To cut a long story short they have now realised that I will take them to court if they don't behave appropriately and due to the change in the law will ask for reporters to be present, as a result they have now backtracked on their behaviour.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1kju9by/labour_council_acted_unlawfully_over_low_traffic/mrps9t0/,,Labour council acted unlawfully over low traffic neighbourhood

So I think it is a useful exercise to first simply imagine what you think happened in this case, based purely on the headline and your general vibes.

Das sorgt dafür, dass die Behinderung schnell ""umgangen"" werden kann und belastet den Falschparker finanziell nicht in Abhändigkeit von dem Brand sondern lediglich dem Schaden an den Autos. Das ist wesentlich fairer. 

Warum nicht am Brandschaden beteiliegen?

Wenn da wegen Gasleck nen halbes Haus in die Luft gesprengt hat kannst du schlecht sagen, dass da der Falschparker nen paar Millionen hinlegen soll. Vor allem lässt sich das sehr schlecht quantifizieren, wie viel von dem entstandenen Brandschaden aufgrund der Verzögerung aufgetreten sind.

post,My latest Low-Traffic neighbourhood,2025-09-16 23:41:42,"I just converted another area of my city into an LTN, to create a cycling and walking safe neighbourhood. I've attached some stills of the improvements. I upgraded the main road to include a segregated cycle lane.

I then placed some modal filters at some junctions (and other strategic points), to allow only cycles and pedestrians through. This should hopefully reduce traffic in this area, as it has in all my other LTNs.

I also replaced a vehicle bridge with two separate cycle and pedestrian bridges (last image)

How did I do? What other improvements can I make city-wide to help cyclists and pedestrians? How else can I improve my LTNs?

P.S. bus services are still running normally through this LTN, and are servicing the area well, without any significant delays. In fact, the reduced traffic from the LTN will hopefully \*increase\* bus timings.

post,"In light of Enes Kanter's injury, let's take a look at other stupid ways NBA players got injured.",2017-01-27 16:03:06,"**""ARE YOU EXTINGUISHING TO ME??""**

During 2012 playoffs a frustrated Amare Stoudemire, for unknown reasons, attacked a fire extinguisher minutes after the New York Knicks' Game 2 loss to the Miami Heat. The Knicks power forward suffered lacerations on his left hand which required stitches. He suffered the laceration on the inside of his palm, on the side of his hand closest to the pinkie. Subsequently, Amare has been extinguished from Game 3. It is important to note, that fire extinguisher's side of the story was never heard.

------------------------------

**BEEP, BEEP**

Shortly after inking a six-year, $66 million dollar contract extension, Monta Ellis torpedoed Golden State's 2008-09 season when he tore a ligament in his left ankle and sustained a high-ankle sprain in a ""low-speed"" moped accident. So not only did he screw his team over, he lost serious Man Points for getting injured not only on a moped...but while driving said moped at low speeds. 

---------------------------------------

**UPSETING THE GODS**

Tony Allen blew out his knee -- tearing both ACL and MCL -- while trying to throw one down after the whistle had blown. That's a direct message from the Basketball Gods, and it can be interpreted as: ""Thou shall not showboat, mortal fool!"" Oh, and he also missed the dunk.

----------------------------------------

**BIG BALLS TOO MUCH FOR THE WOLVES' TITLE HOPES**

The Minnesota Timberwolves' best chance of reaching the Finals with Kevin Garnett came in 2004, but Sam Cassell injured his hip before the start of the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers defeated the Wolves and played the Detroit Pistons in the Finals. ""All the time,"" said Flip Saunders about Cassell's injury. ""It was his hip. He made a shot out of the corner against Sacramento in Game 7 [of the conference semifinals], and he did his little Big Balls dance, and from that, he created a little avulsion fracture in his hip. No question, I think about that dance all the time. But that’s the NBA. I went to four straight conference finals in Minnesota and Detroit, and we had injury issues in each one. The team that wins the title is usually the healthiest team.""

-------------------------

**PRO BOWL**

Andrew Bynum injured his knee when going bowling, while being injured. Yes he did.

---------------------------

**NIGHT PARALYSIS**

In 2012 Kevin Love slept with his right arm extended off his bed all night and when he woke up he couldn't move it and had to miss the next game. 

------------------------

**STEVE THE SPIKE**

Lakers guard (at the time) Steve Blake suffered a puncture wound to his left foot after stepping on a spike strip in a parking lot. He was out for three weeks. Blake said he hurt himself when he ""got distracted going back to my truck"". Good job, Steve.

--------------------------

**LOTION-EYEZ KILLA**

Charles Barkley missed the Phoenix Suns' 1994-95 season opener because the first layers of his corneas got burned off by body lotion during an Eric Clapton concert. Apparently, allergies and the dazzling stage lights caused Sir Charles to rub his eyes, and he got lotion in them. Phoenix Suns team doctor, Richard Emerson, said: ""It was a chemical reaction to a type of lotion that he uses. I wouldn't anticipate it'll reoccur because I don't think he'll use that type again."" 

---------------------------------


**SLEEPIN' &amp; CHILLIN'**

Prior to the 1995-96 NBA season, BJ Tyler was selected by the Toronto Raptors in the 1995 expansion draft. According to journalist Chris Young's book Drive, Tyler accidentally fell asleep with a pack of ice on his knee, severely damaging it and thus losing all the speed for which he was famed, and subsequently had to retire.

--------------------------

**DISHES GET STICHES**
Brad Miller needed nine stitches in his right index finger after almost chopping it off with a knife while doing dishes last season...on the same day he was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career. Said Miller: ""It's the last time I help do dishes."" Said teammate Mikki Moore: ""When I saw him, it was all wrapped up. So, I said, 'You're going to drop 20 and 20 in two games and then go and cut your knuckle off?' I said, 'That's real smart, Brad.' He said, 'Nah, that's my luck.'"" 

--------------------------------------------

**""THANKS REF""**

During the 2001-02 season, Corey Maggette got so upset over a call that he slammed his hand on the scorer's table in frustration and dislocated the ring and little fingers on his right hand. Maggette ended up with a cast and a four-week vacation.


-------------------------------------

**FINALS MVP**

Ah, Darko, Darko, Darko. He was put in for what was described as a ""token"" appearance in the Pistons' Game 5 blowout of the Lakers in the 2004 NBA Finals. He played 2 minutes, finishing with 1 rebound, 1 steal, 1 turnover...and 1 broken hand. Oh yes he did. The injury required surgury and sidelines him for eight weeks. 

--------------------------

**CAN'T HANDLE THE JOE**

Derrick Coleman -- whose NBA career was limited and cut short largely due to injury problems -- got injured again, only this time it happened while filming an episode of the TV show Pros vs. Joes. DC was participating in a rebounding challenge against some ""average joe"" when he came down from a jump and landed awkwardly, hurting his always-troublesome knee. This means that Coleman probably has the dubious distinction of being the first Pro to ever get injured during battle with a Joe.

-------------------------------------------

**SLICING AND DICING**

The Bulls rookie (at the time) Derrick Rose was forced to miss some practice time because, get ready for it, he cut himself under the elbow on his left forearm. In bed. From a knife he used to slice an apple. Said Rose: ""Silly accident this morning. I went to get a bottle of water, forgot the knife was there and sat down and sliced my arm. I panicked when it first happened. I called [Bulls trainer Fred Tedeschi]. We got it stitched up about 8 [a.m.]. It was a large wound, but they healed it up. I'm good. I could have practiced, but they told me to wait until [today]. I can still dribble, shoot, do all that stuff. I'm hoping they'll let me play.""

------------------------------------

**HOW TO PUT ON A SHOE 101**

In December 2001, before a game against the Washington Wizards, DirK Nowitzki sprained a tendon in his ankle when he put his shoe on improperly and the stomped his foot on the floor to make sure it was on right. The injury was so bad he missed the game. 

---------------------------------------

**HIDDEN DANGERS OF A WALK-THROUGH**

Eddy Curry had to miss a game due to a badly sprained left ankle suffered at...a walk-through at his team's morning shoot-around. Nope. I'm not kidding. Said teammate Malik Rose: ""How do you explain something like that?"" Good question. A very good question.

----------------------------

**E-CITY VS PHYSIOBALL**
Speaking of good questions, here's another: Can a player suffer a more embarrassing injury than spraining his ankle during a walk-through? Well, the answer is ""yes"" my friends. From the New York Daily News: ""Poor Eddy Curry. He sat on the giant blue physioball during a break from Monday's practice and the ball exploded. Eddy fell and scraped and his wrist but should be okay. The ball, which is used for stretching exercises, was pronounced dead at the scene."" This also answers the classic ""How do you know when you're too fat?"" question.

-----------------------------------

**""I TRIED TO WARN HIM"" - Eddy Curry**

Francisco Garcia broke his arm...on a physioball. No, really. At least he wasn't so fat it exploded on him...

-----------------------------

**DIAL 555-INJURY**

Prior to Game 3 of the 1992 first round playoff series between the Indiana Pacers and the Boston Celtics, George McCloud ""held his ankle in a funny way"" while talking on the phone. This somehow injured the ankle so badly he couldn't play in the game and had to sit on the bench in street clothes as his team got eliminated. 

----------------------------

**AGENT ZERO'S BARBERSHOP**

File this one under ""unfortunate pube shaving accidents."" Very unfortunate. I'll let Gilbert Arenas tell the tale: ""When I was new in the NBA the team veterans convinced me to shave, you know, down there, because they said the hair stinks. I used my girlfriend's razor, which was rusty and gave me keloids. The doctor prescribed medicine to dab on, but I just poured it all over. Three days later I woke up screaming. The skin was burnt off my scrotum, down to my crack, everything -- just raw flesh. I still had to run and play, so I used a numbing spray for a month until it healed. Now I use clippers.""

-----------------------------

**OFF TO A GREAT START**

Greg Ostertag fractured the third metacarpal on his right hand in October of 2004 when he tripped on a footstool while getting out of bed. Mind you, this happened after his first day of practice with his new team, the Sacramento Kings.

--------------------------

**THE LUGGAGE CONSPIRACY**

1991 Jeff Ruland made a comeback for the Sixers. He was out of action for five years but attempted to return for the 1991-92 season. However, the comeback ended because of...a luggage cart. Yes, a luggage cart, which was (allegedly) rammed into Ruland's leg by a Celtics employee as he waited for a team bus outside Boston Garden. (It should be noted that Ruland was not a popular in Boston, and he was even nicknamed ""McNasty"" by the Celtics' late great broadcaster Johnny Most.) Ruland said: ""I got run over by a luggage cart. That's hard to swallow. It can't be accidental, they were moving too fast. Whoever could foresee anything like this happening?""

------------------------------------

**PERK'S TIC-TAC-TOE**

Boston's big man (at the time) Kendrick Perkins missed time due to a right big toe that was injured when he dropped a bed on it. ""I was asleep. I guess whoever put my bed together didn't put it together right when I moved, so one side of my bed fell. My bed was tilted, so I got out of my bed to go push down on the other side. And when I was about getting ready to push down on the other side, the headboard started coming in. So I tried to push the headboard back so it wouldn't fall over. My foot was under the bed and the other side of the bed fell on my foot."" Man, I hate it when that happens.

-------------------------------

**CRIPPLING BUZZER-BEATER**

During the mid-90s, Kevin Johnson won a regular season game on a buzzer-beating shot and received a crippling bear hug from teammate Charles Barkley. And I mean ""crippling"" in the literal sense. Chuck squeezed Kevin so hard his shoulder was dislocated. (At least Barkley didn't rub any body lotion in KJ's eyes.) He was out of action for the next two weeks. KJ also had hernia surgery in 1996 after years of abdominal problems that were allegedly brought on by picking up teammate Oliver Miller to celebrate a play.

----------------------------

**TALL PEOPLE PROBLEMS**

Kobe Bryant hurt his back. Vacuuming. But he says it's because of vacuum size discrimination. 

------------------------------

**AIR TAKES OUT BIRD**

In the fall of 1988, Larry Bird was attempting a comeback from dual achilles surgery when he permanently injured in his back. How? He was undercut by Michael Jordan, who then fell on Bird...in the Kenny Rogers Charity Basketball Tournament in Kentucky. According to his second autobiography, Bird Watching: On Playing and Coaching The Game I Love, Bird said: ""We were in the final minutes of this charity basketball game when I went up for a rebound and came down a little sideways. Michael Jordan was going for the ball too, and he landed on my back. Right away I knew I was in trouble. I had torn additional portions of the disc wall, and my back was really traumatized. I didn't know it then, all the way back in 1989, but that was the beginning of the end…I never came all the way back."" 

------------------------

**""I GOT A YACHT TO FEED""**

Latrell Sprewell, the man whose hands once said 'hello' to his coach's neck, broke his hand by taking a swing at the boyfriend of a female party guest who threw up on his yacht. But it seems that Spree's punches were roughly as accurate as his jumpers (42 percent lifetime): He whiffed and punched the wall instead. Sprewell tried to cover up the incident, but some of his guests leaked the story and the Knicks fined Spree $250,000 for not reporting the injury. Sprewell complained about it to the press. ""They talk about being a family but they're not sticking with me. The biggest thing to me is that I'm hurt. So don't kick me when I'm down."" 

--------------------------

**DNP - GAMING**

Lionel Simmons suffered an injury during the 1990-91 season: He missed two games with wrist tendonitis caused by overtraining on his Nintendo Game Boy.

Note that, a year later, Derrick McKey missed seven games with the same injury.

-------------------------- 

**AQUA LUC**

During the 1996-97 season, the Bulls lost Luc Longley's services for seven weeks after he got hurt body surfing. Yeah. Luc was body-surfing off the coast of Los Angeles coast when an unexpectedly strong wave drove him shoulder-first into the ocean floor and knocked his clavicle and shoulder out of place.

--------------------

**HIS SMOKENESS**

Although Michael Jordan  was already kinda sorta unofficially retired (again), Jordan severed a tendon in his right index finger (i.e., on his shooting hand) while using a cigar cutter in January 1999. Officially listed as a ""a laceration of the flexor tendon,"" Jordan needed surgery to repair it and six weeks of occupational therapy to rehabilitate it.

--------------------------

**HIGH MUGGSY**

Muggsy Bogues, the tiny, tiny man (who was playing for the Toronto Raptors at the time) missed the second half of a game against the Portland Trailblazers after accidentally sucking in some ointment fumes during a halftime treatment. Said Bogues: ""Never happened to me before and I hope it never happens again. That was one of those fluke things you don't even dream about.""

---------------------------

**TEAM BONDING**

This entry harkens back to 2003, during Portland's infamous ""Jail Blazer"" era. Ruben Patterson ended up with a shiny black eye thanks to a five-knuckeled ""hello"" from teammate Zach Randolph. Patterson, who earlier that season had been arrested on suspicion of domestic assault, was arguing with Qyntel Woods, who himself had been recently cited by Portland police on marijuana possession charges after a traffic stop, when Randolph stepped in and sucker-punched Patterson. While, it should be noted, Patterson was being restrained by teammates. Nice, huh? Patterson then promised not to retaliate...until his probation expired in May (it was April at the time). Good times all around. 

-------------------------

**EXTREME HOBBIES**

While playing for the Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan-less 1993-94 season, Scott Williams had a string of bizarre injuries. First, he missed four days of practice after straining his shoulder at the team's annual bowling outing. A few days later, he hurt his back lifting a TV he bought on sale. Then, later in the season, he injured a tendon behind his right kneecap while stretching, and that was the end of his season.

--------------------------

**RADMAN'S WINTER X-GAMES**

In February of 2007, Vladimir Radmanovic separated his shoulder falling on a patch of ice in Park City, Utah. Or so he claimed. But a few days later, Radmanovic admitted that he had actually hurt himself in a fall during a jump while snowboarding. Said the Radman: ""The truth is that I hurt myself in a fall while snowboarding. Being young and sometimes immature, I initially panicked and made up a false story about how I hurt myself. However, over the past few days my conscience has been bothering me terribly. I am not a dishonest person and could no longer live with this deception. Therefore, I came forward today and told the truth to the Lakers."" Mind you, his contract specifically banned him from taking part in activities that involve significant risk of injury, including skiing and snowboarding. The space cadet was fined $500,000.


------------------------------------

**LIGHTS OUT**

Carlos Boozer broke his hand after tripping over his gym because it was too dark to see at 6PM. Somebody was knocking at the door, and Boozer rushed to answer. On the way, he tripped over his big gym bag in the hall and fell. He went down awkwardly on his right hand and felt it pop. The neighbours later testified they heard an extremely loud ""AHHH AND-ONE!"" echoing through the neighbourhood.

That's the judgement. The case is, as usual, being made out to be something it isn't. This is not some ruling about the merits or not of LTNs, but about whether this specific council competently complied with the statutory consultation requirements. (They didn't.)

Of course most LTN opposition is from conspiracy nuts and right-wing loons, but UK councils are commonly incompetent, and so are quite capable of either buggering up LTNs so badly that the (unquestionable) benefits are minimised and the disadvantages maximised, or of imposing obviously-bad LTNs for local political reasons\*. This ruling has nothing to say about the merits of this particular LTN, though when a council is incompetent enough to mess up the statutory consultation, I have no confidence that they will have come up with a good LTN scheme. 

\*I am not familiar with every LTN in London, by any means, but out of the fairly limited number I've seen, most are quite well designed, and two are frankly dreadful: one has taken all the traffic from a number of wealthy roads, to the benefit of wealthy homeowners, and shoved it onto roads running past schools predominantly used by the poorer parts of the community; another seems to be pretty blatantly designed to stop poor people going to or through a rich area, with a ridiculous time-cost to the residents of the LTN due to the only entries and exits being on a very congested stretch of dual carriageway, permitting travel in only one direction, with no sensible way to go in the other direction.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1kis29q/west_dulwich_lowtraffic_neighbourhood_ltn/mrhjd5u/,,"West Dulwich low-traffic neighbourhood (LTN) unlawful, High Court rules"
comment,,2025-05-12 22:58:47,"You already got some pretty comprehensive replies on your other post so I’m not going to waste time debating the general merits of LTNs.

What I will say, specifically linked to this post, is that the likes of the West Dulwich Action Group aren’t actually looking for the nuance you are alluding to (by the way I never implied that the matter isn’t nuanced). Going through the trouble of taking an entire council to court kind of gives away your intentions. 

London remains a heavily car-centric city as a whole and this is not sustainable according to any metrics (costs, emissions, air quality, or safety). Change will inherently be awkward and will come with unintended consequences. These types of court cases don’t come from people who want to see change and are, in the grand scheme of things, an impediment to said change.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1kis29q/west_dulwich_lowtraffic_neighbourhood_ltn/mrz9qd5/,,"West Dulwich low-traffic neighbourhood (LTN) unlawful, High Court rules"

Tests are not good for long-term learning, because the human brain is fundamentally task-oriented, and dedicates resources to accomplishing goals. Research has continuously shown that if you study with the primary goal of passing a specific test, you will very quickly forget most of what you learn, because you accomplished the goal and thus no longer need the information. It’s totally unsurprising that people forget what signs mean.

The sign itself should be designed in a way that obviously indicates what it means. That’s why stop signs say STOP in huge readable letters. You don’t actually have to have seen a stop sign to know what I means.

The fact that these signs don’t have slashes or “X”s is genuinely insane.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/10rw2qo/drivers_ed_doesnt_educate_driversthey_hand_out/j6zt399/,,Driver’s Ed Doesn’t Educate Drivers—they hand out licenses to anyone and everyone.

post,Low traffic neighbourhood PCN,2024-09-27 01:29:59,"Just received a PCN for driving past one of those low traffic signs (didn't notice it at all, only 1small one on the side VS the usual 2 big stands). This was 2 blocks away from where I live, as a local resident am I able to get it waived?

It just seems ridiculous that I need to drive a good distance, in traffic, in the wrong direction away from my destination, when I live literally 300m away.

Other points to note:
+ I was driving a Zipcar rental, so can't apply for a blue badge. But again as a local resident is the only way to be able to drive directly home is if I own my own car?? Is it not enough that I live here? And pay taxes here?
+ On the appeal form it said I had to be the ""keeper"" of the car penalised,  it's not enough to be the driver on the penalty. What? I can be name and fined, but I can't appeal even if I commited the infraction? There's no logic or reason to this I can see",17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hackney/comments/1fqa4xv/low_traffic_neighbourhood_pcn/,low-traffic neighbourhood,

post,Inuit residential care centre Larga Baffin faces angry opposition from councillor Diane Deans,2022-04-27 14:17:46,"I had the extreme displeasure of attending a public information session last night on the Larga Baffin proposal on Hunt Club road.

Larga Baffin is a Inuit owned residential care centre for people travelling from Nunavut to Ottawa for emergency medical care unavailable at home, including treatment for cancer and heart disease. Nunavut only has one hospital and they have a huge nursing shortage and low capacity to deal with the medical concerns of residents, so they often fly to Ottawa for care.

Larga Baffin have spent the past 6 years searching for suitable property for a new building. They are currently located on Richmond Road but they are far from hospitals and the airport, and they have to overflow clients to nearby hotels because they don't have enough space. The new proposed location is much closer to the airport and medical facilities, and it's a designed community to support the people travelling for care, rather than an old retrofitted building like where they currently are.

I personally met with Diane Deans on this proposal a couple months, because I saw her opposition to it based on ""traffic"" and ""size"" and ""greenspace"" — the usual NIMBY red flags.

She literally told me that she was concerned it was going to be like the Salvation Army build in Vanier and she was worried that it was going to lead to Indigenous homeless people flooding her neighbourhood.

Keep in mind this is a sitting city councillor who is running for mayor... I was absolutely aghast then, and I still am.

I sat in on the public meeting last night and could not believe the anger and hostility from local residents, whipped into a fury by their city councillor.

Now, she publicly has reverted to claiming that the project is ""grossly oversized"" (the surrounding area is zoned for 6 storey and 9 storey builds — this is a 6 storey proposal) and she is concerned about a huge traffic impact (Hunt Club is a major arterial road, none of these people are bringing cars from Nunavut, and they have medical shuttles to get to and from appointments that serve the community).

Some of the comments at the public meeting were incredibly gross — people asked about the amount of crime this facility would bring, or how we could keep these people out of their local parks — but I wanted to highlight one in particular, which best summarizes the privilege and lack of self-awareness demonstrated by the NIMBY group angry about this project.

[https://twitter.com/DeanTester/status/1519139010324664322](https://twitter.com/DeanTester/status/1519139010324664322)

""I spent a lot of money on this house... WE ARE HERE FIRST!""

I cannot imagine how ignorant a person would have to be to tell a group of Inuit people to stay out of the neighbourhood because you think you were there first... but that's where we're at. Unfortunately, there were 250+ people on this Zoom call last night, and almost all of them were just this angry about the proposal.

If you're like me, you probably don't think that a small group of angry, wealthy homeowners, who only care about their property value, should be able to block a residential care home for desperate Inuit people, here's what you can do:

1. Tweet at dianedeans on Twitter or email her at [diane.deans@ottawa.ca](mailto:diane.deans@ottawa.ca) and let her know you want to see Larga Baffin get their new build as soon as possible, so the Inuit community can receive the world class medical care they deserve.
2. Send your feedback to the City of Ottawa through the DevApps portal — let them know you support this project! [https://devapps.ottawa.ca/en/applications/D01-01-21-0022/details](https://devapps.ottawa.ca/en/applications/D01-01-21-0022/details)
3. Email, call, or tag on social media the chairs of the planning committee — Scott Moffat and Glen Gower — and contact the other members as well, urging them to ignore the NIMBY campaign and approve this project: [https://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/council-committees-and-boards/committees-and-boards/planning-committee](https://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/council-committees-and-boards/committees-and-boards/planning-committee)

That said, where Gent's version falls apart a bit is that despite this having been introduced, there has been basically zero investment in further public transport infrastructure. Also, since more traffic now goes over major trunk roads like the R40 (the ring road around the centre) and N430, the traffic lights are poorly timed so you end up driving from one red light to another very often which in turn, creates traffic jams during rush hour.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/q14zzi/birmingham_to_become_a_supersized_lowtraffic/hfgdp6q/,,Birmingham to become a super-sized low-traffic neighbourhood
comment,,2021-10-05 11:44:48,"&gt;How come? Did the local politicians change or something?

Because of the complicated way Belgium works, public transit and investment in it is managed on the regional (ie: Flanders) level. So basically the city council can lobby the Flemish government as much as they like but if they don't do anything at all, nothing will happen. Flanders currently has a centre-right government which has made several budget cuts in that area so yeah. Meanwhile the local city council is made up of largely leftwing and centre parties so there's some petty squabbling going on in that sense too.

post,How can I make my newly adopted orange stray more comfortable exploring the rest of my house?,2025-12-21 00:26:15,"His name is Jasper. He used to be a stray that lived in my neighbourhood and was fed by many kind passersby (including me). **Once we confirmed that he didn't belong to anyone, we adopted him about a week ago. All things considered, he's adjusting really well** - he stopped hiding day 2, sleeps in his bed and lots of other places, climbs around, looks outside the window at birds, plays with his toys, eats heartily, and loves loves loves affection. He purs and kneads whenever I pet him and  even climbed into my lap. The one night he slept in my room he literally slept ON TOP of me the whole night - on my shoulder when I was side sleeping, on my back when I was stomach sleeping lol. I barely got any sleep, but I'm crazy about him. And I think he's crazy about me too. 

**The only problem? He doesn't seem too interested in leaving 'his room'.**

When we adopted him we decided to go by conventional advice and **gave him his own quiet space to decompress** that's low traffic and less noisy. His home base is in the study - it has his food, litter box, toys, scratching post, bed, everything. **We live in a bungalow and it's on the opposite side of the house as the bedrooms.**

It's worked wonders and **he seems really comfortable there, but he doesn't seem all that interested in exploring past it.** He pokes his head out once in a while, and he's walked around the living room. And like I said, he made it all the way to my room. But **there's too many sounds and wide open spaces**, and the hypervigilance he had when we first got him comes up again. He'll stay there if we coax him but clearly isn't all that comfortable, and prefers we follow him back to 'his room'. 

**It's only been a little more than a week. Do you think he's still adjusting and will eventually feel more confident with time? Or is there something I should be doing that i'm not?** 

He loves affection and being around people, and I love to be with him too. But **I spend a lot of time in my room (I have health issues), and would much prefer if I could give him all the affection he wants while also being in a space that's more comfortable for me. I physically can't be in the study all that long**, so he has to be alone more than he likes.

comment,,2024-11-20 17:20:04,"It’s not as strong a legal argument as you might think 

Courts are reticent to overturn the clear will of the legislature (which constitutionally is the expression of the will of the people) but sometimes the legislature have competing interests. People elect governments who pass laws on things like your right to not have your health harmed, how is a court supposed to know which is more important to a voter? They can’t, so they will make a straight legal judgment on whether the decision is compatible with the law. That’s why courts can and do strike down legislation even if you can argue there is strong democratic support (small boats is a recent example, deportation activity,etc) 

Beside that - when you make a decision you have a load of basic public law requirements - did you consult? Have you analysed the impact? Was the decision fundamentally rational? Etc.

post,Vent: Townhouse suburbs suck,2025-08-23 01:28:22,"I live in a townhouse, and absolutely hate it. I didn't think it would be this bad when moving in, especially considering we picked one specifically without an HOA. I was wrong.

It's so overstimulating. Every single day at least one of my 300 neighbours is getting something done to their home. Someone is always mowing a lawn, cutting down the one tree in their front yard, or getting their roof worked on. How are there construction crew trucks here every single day?? For the low low price of $500k (250 in 2021 when purchased), you too can live in a home where you don't get a single moment of peace. There's a loud car alarm going off every single day, kids are outside screaming 24/7, loud truck engines with no muffler at 5 in the morning. To top it all off, expect to never find a spot to park in front of your own if there's a holiday. 

I had to park my car almost half a block from my house on Mother's day. Honestly maybe I'd understand if it was an apartment complex you're renting at, but when you're paying $500k + property taxes + maintenance + bills I would at least like a parking spot. The streets are so narrow so when you're K-turning from the curb you can expect to be in an almost head on collision with another car going straight down that comes out of nowhere, driving the neighbourhood street at 35mph. Usually a 10 foot tall pickup truck because you really need all that in the New Jersey suburbs as a dentist!!


You get all the downside of living in a city, but none of the benefits. Sure there's a lot of places to spend money. But what difference does it make if you're somewhere rural with one nearby diner/coffee shop, versus 20 Dunkins in the suburbs? There aren't many authentic family businesses, just 15 locations of a Target and Dollar tree. It's crowded AF but nothing is made walkable. You have to take your car everywhere, and if your drive is 2 miles expect it to be at least 20 minutes of you just sitting there in stand still traffic from all the car accidents. I'm done. Moving back to Iowa soon and I am counting down the days",203,https://www.reddit.com/r/Suburbanhell/comments/1mxlwla/vent_townhouse_suburbs_suck/,low-traffic neighbourhood,
comment,,2025-08-23 01:45:04,"I used go live in a townhouse years ago. Now i live in a detached house. The townhouse was actually quieter because all of the landscaping was done by the same company all at once (i guess benefits of the HOA) plus lawns were smaller. Now, theres always one or two neighbors mowing their lawn at any given time.

comment,,2025-08-23 15:05:25,"Townhome without HOA is crazy. The shared roof not getting saved for and not being maintained is just too high of a risk.

comment,,2025-10-25 00:26:44,"This Is why posting on Reddit is ass everyone’s too nice. IMO you’re high ltn- low mtn BUT with a really good base. 

Your chins recessed, your brows are too bushy, you have a bowl haircut that’s thin on the fringe, your nose is deviated, your skins decent and you need to debloat. 

I’m not trying to disrespect you or insult you. You have a good base but this is just my opinion 🙏

Lose weight/fat/debloat, trim your eyebrows, fix your diet, look into ways to fix your chin maybe even surgery and start using minoxidil and finasteride or dutasteride if that doesn’t work bro don’t listen to the side effects just take it and see how your body reacts, if there’s sides then stop there’s no perm damage like I said tho you got a good base, good luck !",,https://www.reddit.com/r/LooksmaxingAdvice/comments/1odrpli/am_i_ltn_how_do_i_improve/nl7rg45/,,Am I LTN?

comment,,2025-10-25 01:00:06,"I really dk about the hair cos it’s thinned so it’s harder to say on it but the back looks good just try to texture and style the top in a nicer way that isn’t a bowl but don’t use dry powder it’ll thin your hair more.

I don’t really see any problem with your lips that you can actually fix I mean the right side looks a little higher than the left maybe ? But nothing noticeably bad ?

Im not an expert so idk if it actually is your chin that’s recessed it looks more like your jaw it’s just really short maybe to fix it for now you could fraud by jutting which is just moving your jaw forward to give you an underbite and see how that looks",,https://www.reddit.com/r/LooksmaxingAdvice/comments/1odrpli/am_i_ltn_how_do_i_improve/nl7wvbg/,,Am I LTN?

post,Should all of central London become one giant LTN?,2025-06-05 17:52:17,"I’m 100% serious. 

Central London is completely and utterly overstuffed with vehicles, and it’s a nightmare to travel through at the best of times - and that’s to say nothing about the pollution and lung destruction caused, the completely unnecessary traffic deaths, and the insane noise and stress that comes from just being exposed to that.

LTNs and pedestrianised zones are a *literal* breath of fresh air - no more having to worry about getting crushed by a speeding two tonne steel Kevin- or Karen-mobile.

Plus, without personal automobiles, there would be SO much more room for cyclists, which would also mean more room for pedestrians as we could expand the pavements.

Remember, cycling is a the most popular form of transportation in London now, the one least likely to cause the death of fellow road users. 

Clearly, there will need to be exceptions - blue badge holders, emergency vehicles and the like. Busses too, but even those would benefit since there would be virtually zero other traffic to contend with. Delivery drivers could be allowed only outside of peak hours (before 8am, let’s say)

Just the other day in my area, a driver was speeding at 40mph in a 20mph main road, and careened around a corner and hit another car and crushed 3 pedestrians agains the shopfront he ran them into. The paramedics had to literally salt the road to prevent the bloodstains from soaking in. 

I don’t  mean to be graphic, but this is the reality of living in a city congested with cars. 

So why not make it virtually impossible to drive one unless for the aforementioned exceptional circumstances?

Why keep allowing cars to take the piss?

EDIT: pedestrianisation would likely cause an economic boom amongst small businesses in those areas it was implemented as your footfall would be so much higher 

EDIT: yes, i’m fully aware this will either get downvoted to hell or become one of the most “controversial” posts on this subreddit - but i’ll steel man this position till the cows come home

comment,,2025-06-05 18:37:29,"Sounds about right. That's a pretty good delimitation of the central area which is densely built and has extensive transport options.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/Zuo8ZFpmd5): November 14, 2023**

I’m 30s F and caused a major blowup in my family and now none of them are talking to me. For background, my hometown is tiny (500pop) and when I went 2 hrs away to “the city” (15,000pop) for college, I loved it. I ended up staying after graduation, got married, and am happy here for a decade. I visit my home town every few weeks or so, call/text my family near daily, and thought we were all good. My family’s pretty small. Just my brother, mom, step dad, dad, step mom, and an aunt and uncle (mom’s siblings, never married, no kids). My mother's grandparents moved to my home town when I was in high school and were just down the street from us. My family has always been pretty drama free (aside from my parent’s divorce when I was a kid) and we’ve been happy. The step-parents were blended in perfectly and we share holidays and celebrations together. We’re all super close and just the perfect little group.

Ever since I moved away, the topic of “when am I moving back?” is constant, and I’ve always laughed it off. My home town has nothing. You have to drive 30 minutes for milk and bread. 60-90 minute one-way commutes to work. And floods shut down the main road every Easter. I love the town, but I love here more. I have parks, stores, community events, a library! The “city” is great. My family grumbles that I need to move back, but I refuse. I've been trying to encourage them to come here, especially since it's not an hour drive to the nearest medical facility.

Now to the meat and potatoes: both my grandparents passed over COVID times. They were both old and their health had been failing for a while so it was only a matter of time. Thankfully they didn’t catch it, but it made visiting them impossible and we survived mostly through FaceTime. They both passed in their sleep months apart. Both were cremated and kept securely under the kitchen sink for safe keeping while the pandemic blew over. That was 2021.

Well, I just found out my family held a funeral for them and scattered the ashes in my uncle’s maple grove over the summer. No one said a word to me about it. I’ve visited numerous times before and after and not one word. I only found out because my great uncle from California posted on Facebook a few weeks ago that he is entering hospice and was so thankful his health stayed strong enough for him to see his little sister (my grandma) to her final resting place. I was confused and called my mom. She was all “Yeah, the funeral we had in July, remember?” Ya’ll, I visited them for the 4th of July. They did the funeral the 8th. Not a word about it to me. They had planned this for months. Long enough to arrange for my infirm great uncle to be brought over from the other side of the country. Apparently, they talked about it “all the time”.

Everyone is convinced I was at the funeral. They SWEAR I was there. I can prove I wasn’t because Google’s got my location history. My hubby is baffled because he was supposedly there, too, but he had to work every weekend in June and July. Time clock doesn’t lie. My family straight up forgot about me. I’m hurt. I’m sad. And they’re pissed at me “for lying”. They think I’m causing drama over nothing. Nothing I say can convince them I wasn’t there. My family is united in this. And they’ve all put me “on read” until I admit I’m wrong. They think I’ve gone nuts. Either there’s a doppelganger of me attending events, or my family doesn’t want to admit they screwed up. I’m not backing down.

Thanksgiving is coming up, and my family’s been vague posting on Facebook about “forgetful kids” and mental health. It’s so freaking weird and I don’t know if I’m in bizzaro world or what’s going on. My mom’s best friend reached out and said I should just admit I was wrong and apologize, that I’m causing my mom so much unnecessary stress. I asked her if she’s checked everyone’s home for CO2. She hung up on me. (We checked our CO2, and our testers are running just fine.) I have reached out to a few people in my home town to check in on my folks, and they all say they're fine. I even spoke with the local volunteer fire fighter group to see if they could check for gas leaks. Not sure if they were able to.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve shown them the proof I wasn’t there, but they know I’m tech savvy and just assume I’ve Photoshopped it. Hubby says we need a break, and we’re going to be staying home this holiday season.

Edit: I don't know the update rules, so I'll post updates to my profile should anyone want them.

&amp;nbsp;

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/LtnPfK7sRw): **November 27, 2023 (13 days later)** 

Not sure how to do updates on posts, so figured I'd post anything on my profile. Folks have private messaged me and this will be easier I think?

It's 11/27 and Thanksgiving just happened. Hubby and I stayed home. We got a small turkey and made our own little thanksgiving. It was nice. We ate around noon, then watched a movie, and later sat outside with a bottle of wine to watch the sun set behind the trees and neighbor houses.

We usually take the day before off, drive to my folks, stay the night, and help with the Thanksgiving Day cooking. So it wasn't until Wednesday night that my mom broke the silence. Mom called and asked when I was showing up, and I told her we were staying home this year, but for them to have a happy Thanksgiving, and to give the rest of the family my love. She was quiet for a long time after I said that, and I think she eventually mumbled an ""okay"", or something, and hung up. It wasn't an angry hang up. Just a hang up. On Thanksgiving day, I sent a group ""Happy Thanksgiving!"" gif to our family group chat. I received a few ""happy Thanksgiving""'s back. No one's said anything else. There's been no posts on Facebook.

&amp;nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/CG950OzDkS): **December 12, 2023 (15 days later)**

So, I think I mentioned in one of my comments that my dad and I usually talk on the phone every Sunday morning. We're both early risers so we'd chat over our morning coffees and watch the sunrise. Him and I haven't really spoken since this all went down and it's been tough. I'm used to talking to him, you know?

Well, I was sitting outside in my usual spot, watching the sun rise and freezing my butt off, and he called me. I'm not entirely sure how to describe the emotions I felt. It was a mix of panic, hope, terror, happiness, and dread. I ended up answering because I just had to know what he wanted. It was an awkward conversation. He didn't address the current ""drama"", but instead tiptoed around the situation with all the grace of an cow on stilts. For instance, a simple ""How are you doing?"" Type question was answered with a ""Not good."" And the whole conversation would stall out for a bit because he knew why I wasn't doing well. So we ended up talking about the weather, the various winter birds we'd seen in our feeders, and the Christmas decorations around town. Things like that.

Eventually he asked if we were coming out for Christmas, and sounded sad when I told him we weren't. He asked if him and step mom could come visit us instead, and I told him it wasn't a good idea this year. That hubby and I were going to spend a quiet holiday together. I let him know he should be receiving some gifts at his PO Box any day now, so to please pick them up from the post office and put them under the family tree for everyone. He said he'd ship ours to us as well.

And that was pretty much it. No crazy drama to report. The only posts on Facebook have been the usual Christmas excitement ones, countdowns, photos of Santa, silly gift ideas, photos of company Christmas parties.

On a personal note: Hubby and I are doing alright. Our health is good, our spirits high, and we're as solid as ever. We each got Christmas bonus' at our jobs, so we're excited about that. They're not large, but we're happy to have them. We have also done advent calendars for the first time ever. I got him a Lego one, and he got me a hot chocolate one. We're going to do the calendars again next year. Maybe make a tradition out of it.

Everyone please have a safe and happy holidays.

I'm really touched a lot of Internet strangers are worried about me and I wanted to ensure everyone that inheritance is most likely not an issue here. I'd almost be relieved if it was, because then it would at least make some sense. Money does weird things to people, you know?

No one in my family is wealthy by any means. After my grandparents' passed, their small estate was used to pay for their end of life expenses and remaining assets split up. Everyone directly related got an equal split (so excluded my dad and the step parents). I don't remember the exact amount I received, but it was around $5k if I recall. My brother gave me his share, too, so I could finish paying off my college debt while the interest freeze was active.

The great uncle from California has kids and grand kids, and great grandkids of his own, and also isn't wealthy. I think one of his kids makes good money doing something in finance, but I'm not entirely sure. I can't imagine he left us anything, as we hardly knew him. My mom, aunt, and uncle only met him a few times in their lives, and my brother and I even less. Grandma and him were close, but I don't think he liked my grandpa much.

[Christmas](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/ktVOxyJIlS): **December 25, 2023 (nine days later)**

I hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas. I've received a lot of support through my posts and I'm really grateful. Writing these updates have had a therapeutic effect.

Yesterday was Sunday, but I didn't answer my dad when he called. I just really didn't feel up to a pointless chat, so let it go to voicemail. He tried to reach me a few times throughout the day, but I didn't answer.

Our bestie last minute invited us over to his house for Christmas day lunch (today), so husband and I were busy all Christmas Eve making cookies, peanut brittle, and homemade suckers/hard candies for his kids. Mom tried to reach out as well, but I also ignored her calls.

We had a BLAST at lunch! Our friend's kids are a lot of fun to be around. They got some techy presents from their grandparents (Quest vr headset and steam decks, lucky little rascals) Friend and his wife aren't good with tech, while hubby and I are, so we helped get them set up while our friend played a good host to his folks and inlaws. The grandparents didn't realize that a Steam deck required a Steam account, so we got the kids all their own accounts set up, added them to our steam friends lists, and gifted them some games. We also bought them a few VR games for their headset, and they were off to the races with Beat Saber in no time.

As for my folks: My brother texted and asked if we could talk sometime tomorrow. I think me ignoring mom and dad has caused some kind of upset. Which they deserve.

&amp;nbsp;

[Brother’s call](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/k2sVsFKnow): **December 26, 2023 (next day)**

Spoke with my brother over the phone this morning.

For starters, he apologized for everything. Him and I are good (for now). For a bit of background, my brother and I are only 2 years apart. There weren't a lot of kids around growing up, so the two of us were often stuck doing stuff together. So we have a lot of shared interests and passions. He's been pretty silent on this whole matter, but still ""part of the group"", if you know what I mean. I think the thought of losing him out of my life was probably the most painful, because he's always been there. He was my rock until I met my husband. He's definitely a Mama's boy, though, so anything mom wanted, he made sure she got. I'm happy to have him back.

Without further ado, here's the story from the horse's mouth:

Mom apparently had a cancer scare late last year (which no one told me about, go figure), and dad had a stint put in his heart back in January (which I did know about). This ""sense of mortality"" has apparently lit a fire under Mom's ass to get me back home. But since I wasn't reacting to her passive aggressive hinting, she and step mom decided to go full crazy. My great uncle's health was bad, and he'd been asking about funeral arrangements for his sister (my grandma) for a while, so the moms decided to plan it. And use the event as a giant middle finger to me. They kept all the planning pretty hush-hush between the two of them, so no one on our side of the family actually knew about the funeral until like 2 weeks before. The moms said they'd invited hubby and I. No one thought anything about it. No one thought to mention, confirm, or check with me.

The plan was to scatter the ashes, say a few words, and maybe head to town for lunch. It was a small affair. The mom's didn't even tell the family that our great uncle was coming for it. Like I said, it was a small thing. Barely a footnote. No one thought it was odd because we're pretty chill people.

4th of July happens. Hubby and I are out. No one thought to mention it, as we were all busy celebrating and having a great time. Any time the topic of ""this weekend"" would start, the conversation would be quickly shifted by one of the moms. We went back home.

8th of July happens. Great uncle rolls into town with a few of his kids, grandkids, and great grandkids, and it's a surprise to everyone (but the moms). Everyone drives to the maple grove and the moms have brought a ton of food and stuff. It's a full blown party. No one on my side noticed I wasn't there, because there were so many extra faces outside the usual group. They did the spreading of the ashes, they said their words, they ate, they had a great time. It wasn't until our great uncle left, and all his side left with him, that they realized I wasn't there. And hadn't been there.

And this is where the crazy went up a notch. My brother says the moms were happy no one noticed I wasn't there. And that this was proof to everyone that I needed to move back because I was so easily forgotten about. Because none of them thought to reach out, right? They basically did a ton of guilt tripping manipulation bullshit and it made everyone upset at me for not showing up. Somehow it was my fault for being excluded. So suddenly everyone was on their side with ""sticking it to me"".

But then a few months went by, and tempers cooled, and then I guess the horror of it set in. Followed by the shame, but by then they were ""in too deep"". How do you undo something like this? And since I hadn't brought it up, I guess they figured they would all just stay quiet about it and hope I never asked about a funeral.

That's when I discovered the situation from my great uncle's Facebook and called my mom, who panicked and went with the stupidest solution. Claiming I was there. Don't I remember?

I ended up talking with a few friends from high school, mentioning the situation, and word got back to those in town. So suddenly town gossip and little old church ladies got involved. Was I, or wasn't I at the funeral? Did my family forget to invite me to the funeral of the only grandparents I'd ever know? Or am I just causing a ruckus? My brother said they all just went with mom's answer. Of course they wouldn't forget me. Of course I was there. Of course they're good people. And it just snowballed.

The family expected me to eventually fold. I'm usually a nonconfrontational person, so me sticking to my guns was unexpected. And then I missed Thanksgiving. And now Christmas. With no sign of backing down. And I guess the realization that I could just stop being part of their lives is setting in and my parents are panicking. He's tried just getting them to apologize and explain, but stubbornness prevails. They want to rug sweep, but I'm not letting them.

My brother is upset with everything that's happened. He's realized just how crappy it all has been and he wants nothing to do with it anymore. But since he lives with my mom, he can't ""get away from it"".

He has asked if he can come stay with us for a little bit. I spoke with hubby, and he's in agreement with me that my brother can come crash in our spare bedroom for as long as he wants. Brother works remotely, so it's no trouble for him to pick up and go. I believe he's making the trip today or tomorrow. Not entirely sure, but I expect crap to hit the fan when he arrives.

On a side note, hubby's stoked that my brother and I made up. The two usually game together, but haven't due to ""the situation"". He's downstairs right now setting up his man cave in preparation for my brother's arrival. I'm happy to see him so excited.

&amp;nbsp;

[Brother's Here](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/HOf5rAGNVp): **December 27, 2023 (next day)** 

My brother rolled in late last night. He'd obviously been crying and when I opened the door, he just held me and sobbed. I'd never seen him like that before and soon both of us were just standing in the doorway crying into one another. He kept apologizing. Over and over again. Said he wasn't sure why he went with it. Just kept saying sorry. Hubby got him all set up in the spare bedroom while brother and I talked. My brother's a wreck. He's always been a big guy, but he's lost a lot of weight and his clothes just hang off him. If I didn't know better, I'd think he was on drugs. We talked for a little bit before bed and he re-explained everything for my husband. I'd told hubby the story, but it was just so weird that hearing it again helped. 

This morning my brother was up at dawn making some coffee and getting his work day going. Hubby's off all week (lucky) so hubby made us working folk some pancakes and bacon. So far everything's peaceful. We've decided not to answer any calls from our family. They've been made aware that he arrived safely, and that we are going to spend the New Years together, and that we're not answering any calls until January 1st. They may text if they wish. I'm sure they're losing their minds. Serves them right. 

Everyone, have a safe and happy new years! Don't drink and drive!

&amp;nbsp;

[Happy 2024!](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/OQBOmfSsff): **January 2, 2024 (six days later)**

I hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable holidays, and may the new year be full of joy and happiness!

Not too much of an update. Things here have been quiet. My brother's settled in nicely and he's a great housemate. Our place isn't very big, but we have full basement and a nice outside patio/porch area so it doesn't feel crowded at all with the extra addition. He's a quiet and clean guy. No hassle at all. He got some fresh clothes from the Walmart, a haircut, and trimmed his beard, so he's more ""presentable"" now. He's a lady killer when he gets cleaned up. He's made nice with the (very nosy, but kind) retired couple next door and is adapting to ""city living"" nicely.

Folks back home have been mostly well behaved. There's been a few texts back and forth, as we're not answering calls. Mom mainly wants to know when brother's coming back, but he's keen on staying here for a while. Mom said I can't ""keep him"" and I told her he's a grown ass man and can do what he wants. Brother says he has her blocked after she ORDERED him to return home.

Brother has tentatively asked if he could stay long term, should he decide to, or at least longer than a usual visitor would stay. Which we're fine with. He has a good paying job and could afford an apartment, but he's never lived on his own and I would guess he has some anxiety about it. Should that be the case, he'll start paying us some rent and we'd probably adjust to give him the basement as his own space.
&amp;nbsp;

[Had to change the locks](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/ktBovEqT5T): **January 17, 2024 (15 days later)**

My brother is officially staying with us for the long haul. Hubby and him spent all Sunday organizing the basement and shifting things around so he now has his own area to be comfortable in. He's pretty handy and has also started fixing little things around our house. Our windows and doors have never closed and locked/unlocked smoother. He even fixed one of the closets we never use because we can never get the darn door open. Sadly, he also had to change the locks on our house and get us all new keys.

This is because while hubby and I were out this Saturday, the moms showed up. They'd been calling and texting us all week, but we weren't really answering them, so I guess the two decided to drive over and hash it out in person. They have emergency keys to my place, and just let themselves in. Brother told them to leave, they argued, and my nosy (but kind) neighbors called the police when they noticed the commotion. So, we get a call from neighbor's wife, return home to some cops in our yard, all the neighbors out ""vacuuming their trees"", and my nosy (but kind) neighbors standing on my porch with my brother behind them, doing their best Gandalf ""You shall not pass"" impression.

Had to talk with the cops, explain that we were having a family dispute and word vomited. I don't really remember what all I said, and was shaking a lot. Our local cops are really great. Fantastic guys and gals in blue, and took it all in stride. It's really cold here, so one had me join him in his cruiser with the heat on, and gave me a bottle of water to calm down while we talked. They asked if we wanted the moms trespassed but I wasn't sure if that counted as a criminal charge so just asked the cops if they could just make them leave, which the cops did with no fuss. I think the moms were shocked we were taking this so seriously. They didn't fight or scream at us. Just left quietly.

My dad promised me he'd make sure his wife left us alone. ""Or else"". He said he'd also have a stern talk with my mom. Him and I talked Sunday morning, and he seemed absolutely at the end of his rope. Husband jokingly told my dad he could move in, too. To which he declined.

Not sure where to go from here, but we're getting some ring cameras installed once they arrive. And everyone but my dad is blocked. Hopefully they all just leave us alone.

&amp;nbsp;

[Nothing New To Report]( https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/xuZhQuEREx): **February 2, 2024 (16 days later)**

Had a lot of DMs for updates, but don't have much anything to report on. The moms are behaving themselves. All's quiet on the western front. Felt weird ignoring or copy/pasting ""no updates"" to everyone, so here's what we've been doing, should anyone care.

Dad got a new bird/squirrel feeder from Amazon (looks like a little picnic table for a child's dolly but has a mesh top for the bird seed. I think it's supposed to be for chickens?) It's totes adorbs. To his horror, it also works as a Cooper hawk feeder, so now he's ""fortifying his defenses"" and putting up some trellises around it. He'll have to wait till warmer weather before planting anything to grow on them.

We had some ring cameras installed and put in a motion-activated camera that double functions as a light bulb. It goes in the light fixture outside the front door and is pretty cool. Video quality isn't all that great, but it's a nice addition I guess. It does overlook the bird feeders, so I've been watching it on my lunch breaks on the days I have to go into the office.

Hubby and brother are feuding. They started a coop farm in Stardew Valley a few days ago and they both want to romance Leah. My husband confided in me that he's also been romancing Sebastian as a backup. I'm not sure why he's keeping this a secret, but he's pretty smug about it.

&amp;nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/6pVlXoBULZ): **February 27, 2024 (three weeks later)**

My dad came out for a visit over the weekend. We had a good time and the weather was lovely for some grilling and beers. It was really nice to see him again and he seemed healthy and in good spirits.

Here's his report from back home: Step mom (dad's wife) has started to realize she's screwed up. I credit her change of mindset to the fact that my dad sat her down and laid it out for her: she leaves his kids alone, or she's getting divorce papers. That apparently shut her up right quick, because they had a prenup done when they married and I'm not sure the details of it, but it wouldn't end favorably for her. She hasn't worked in years, so I imagine she'd be eligible for alimony? But I'm not versed in any of that legal mumbojumbo. Dad didn't seem too worried about it, so I'm not gonna worry about it.

Step dad was pissed the police were involved in the last ""mom visit"" (despite no one getting arrested or anything) 
and was in a ""the kids are out of control and need to be reigned back in"" mindset. When my dad pointed out that ""the kids"" in question were all in their mid-30s, it took some of the steam out of stepdad's sails. According to my dad, even my mom looked a little surprised when he said that. So, part of me is wondering if a good chunk of this whole thing is my mom not truly realizing that her kids were grown, and no longer children she could make demands of. Both of the moms have left us alone. I expected my mom to continue to kick up a fuss, but I think the cops spooked her.

There was a wonderful suggestion by a comment or to get their pastor involved, which I passed along to my dad. Dad has since spoken to their pastor about everything. He's a young guy, relatively new to their church, and joked that his first month on the job he had to do 3 funerals in a row and his new ""flock"" were just dying to get away from him, so he's got a sense of humor which is nice. The new pastor agreed to sit down with everyone and help the family hash it all out in a true ""Come to Jesus"" type moment next month, so that maybe we could celebrate Easter together as our first holiday as a family. Dad said the pastor was aware our family was having some troubles, but unsure of exactly what was going on, and since he was new, the pastor didn't want to pry. He has also agreed to do a small service down at my uncle's maple grove later in the summer, as it usually floods and is a muddy mess all spring. According to my dad, my aunt and uncle are so over all the drama and just ready to move on, so I expect hugs and apologies from them when we next meet.

Stardew Valley Update: My brother was victorious in the grand fight for Leah. It was a hard battle. Well fought. When my husband exposed his plans to woo Sebastian all this time, it was quite the betrayal. Dramatics aside, their farm is really cute and I'm so happy they're enjoying the game!

&amp;nbsp;

[Update 4/1 - Final one I think](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/Vu27IFAIM8): **April 1, 2024**

Happy April Fools everyone! I hope you all check your caramel apples for stray onions before taking a bite! I also hope your Easter weekend was a delightful one.

It is with great joy that I tell you all about our most recent update! Possibly even a conclusion to this whole ordeal.

The entire family (aunt, uncle, moms, dads, brother, me, husband) and pastor met at my dad's house and we all sat down to hash the situation out. As expected from what my dad said, my aunt and uncle greeted us all with apologies and hugs, which was nice. My uncle usually helps host the Easter egg hunts with the church and he brought our Easter baskets to give to us in case us kids weren't sticking around the for the weekend. I'm not sure why but seeing it made me tear up and feel stupid, because it was just a basket of candy but it meant a lot to me for some reason.

The pastor led us in a prayer and talked about forgiveness and such. He then asked us all to talk one at a time about how we're feeling and what we want the end result of today to be. No one was allowed to interrupt so everyone got to talk. It was nice. The consensus for the group was that most everyone wanted things to go back to ""normal"". The only ones who had any variance off this was my mom and step dad. They both wanted all us kids to move back to the area.

The pastor asked them why they wanted us back, and neither could give a good reason other than ""because family"", and the pastor asked us if we were thriving where we were. And we said we were. He asked if we were happy there. Which we were. He then asked my mom and step dad if they wanted us to give up our happiness to make them happy.

And Mom broke down and said no. We all had a good cry. The pastor then asked about the funeral and lies that led up to it and followed it and how it made us all feel and what we wished we'd done differently if we had the chance. It was all very emotional, but in a good way, you know? Everyone apologized and admitted they f-ed up and did a really crappy thing.

We all talked for a long, long time and the pastor was a great mediator. Eventually we all reached some sort of resolution and I think we're good now. Emotions are still high and a little raw in areas, but we stayed for Easter weekend and had a nice time. We're going to keep moving forward slowly and try to repair the relationship, but I believe we're well and truly out of the woods.

As for my brother, he's still staying with us, and mom will stop trying to guilt trip him back home. He's thinking about renting a small apartment in our area but we're not pushing him to make a decision. He knows he's welcome to stay as long as he wants. I think he wants to try dating (he's had a few girlfriends but never anything serious) and is embarrassed to bring any girls around our place, lol. He's been going to a few random classes/bookclubs at the local library for something free to do and hitting it off with all the little old ladies who attend, and they keep trying to hook him up with girls his age who they know. He has been on a few lunches/coffee dates with a couple girls, but I think he's too embarrassed by the attention to give it a real try at ""dating"" any of them. He's happy, though, which is all I could ask for.

I'm not sure if there will be any more updates, as I think it's all be resolved about as much as it can be at the moment. I wanted to thank you all for your words of advice and giving me a place to vent and scream into the void. Please be kind to one another and to yourselves. Thank you.

&amp;nbsp;

[Small, happy update](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/jbA3zFl2AK): **May 7, 2024**

Things as wonderful as the moment. Still doing baby steps with The Moms. We're texting and talking on the phones more, which is nice. Very civil.

Dad ""accidentally"" bought a bunch of hand crafted bird feeders at a craft fair. By accidentally, I mean: he had a little too much fun in the beer tent, went for a stroll while step mom wasn't looking, and stumbled upon a guy's booth and bought ""one of each"". He wouldn't tell me how MANY ""one of each"" was, but he cackled like a witch when I asked. Step mom said she's forcing him to give a few to me, so I'm expecting a delivery or a Dad-visit any day now.

My brother is officially ""going steady"" with a girl. We've met her a few times and she seems like a real sweetheart. She's our age and has a little boy (5-6 years old, I haven't asked) from a previous relationship (The dad's not in the picture from what I can gather). She's the granddaughter of one of his Book Club members, so the old ladies made good match makers in the end. The relationship is still very new and I'm routing for them.

No new Stardew Valley updates. Work has been a little crazy lately and I haven't been able to play much of anything, and brother has been distracted by his new lady friend. So, husband finally started Baldur's Gate 3, and fell for Gale's ""magic trick"" so now those two are a thing. I expect him to be sufficiently distracted from reality for the next few weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Been a while](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/RlgDOkYBME): **March 3, 2025 (10 months later)**

I hope everyone's doing wonderful! I know it's been a while. Lots of little happy updates incoming!

My brother moved out! He's like 5 minutes away, so it's not far but he's officially living on his own. He's going steady with the same girl. She's a catch! Sweet as can be! She fits in to the family so well and everyone just adores her. She's going to school to be a nurse and I know she's gonna crush it. Hubby and I get to babysit her kiddo on the regular and he's a total hoot. At first, he was overly polite and a bit shy, but one day my husband picked him up and husband was wearing his SCP hoodie. Turns out the kid is a MASSIVE SCP fan. So we've all bonded and he's really opened up around us. Assuming my brother and her are still together come August (we're hoping they continue going strong) there's talk about kiddo taking the school bus to our place after school. There's a stop at the bottom of our street and it would be no trouble for us to have him chill at our house for a few hours until mom's off work. Have him work on homework or whatever. I might have to learn whatever ""new math"" is, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

Mom's mellowed the frick out. She's stopped her insanity and seems to have accepted the new normal. Dad says she's ""turning back into the woman he once married."" Which is a bit depressing, but also good, I guess? From what he says, mom has started cross stiching again. Which, my brother and I never knew she knew how. Apparently, she used to be massively into the hobby, but after my brother and I were born, she was terrified we'd get into the needles and hurt ourselves, so she put it all away and never touched it again. Step-dad says she's much more relaxed and calm lately, which I'm happy about. She's respected our boundaries and has only come to visit when we allowed it. Our relationship has improved drastically.

Dad and step-mom are also doing well. Step mom and us actually bonded quite nicely during January. She needed hip surgery and since Dad's house has more steps than High Hrothgar, it was decided that she would stay with my husband and I. Her doctor scheduled the surgery at our local branch of their hospital and after she was released, she came back to our place. She ended up staying with us for most of January due to a massive ice storm that came tearing through the area. I've spent time with the woman, but never like this or for this long. It was like seeing a whole new side of her I never knew. When dad finally came to pick her up, I was actually sad to have her leave.

You will all be happy to hear that we did manage to do a memorial for my grandparents. It was exactly what my soul needed. I didn't realize how much I NEEDED to have that closure until it was done. Like someone took a weighted blanket off me and I could breathe again. It was a lovely service and a few of the little old church ladies made us some finger foods to have back at the church afterwards and we all sat around eating and sharing stories about Grandma and Grandpa.

Our next scheduled visit is for Easter and I can honestly say I'm looking forward to it. I feel like I have my family back again.

Please be kind to each other and take care of yourselves. Thank you for letting me shout into the void.

**Commenter:** Oh this is a fantastic update. I am so pleased that this whole saga has come through the other side in a **nice** way. So often these kind of things don’t have happy endings and I’m thrilled that this one does. Thank you for updating us all.

comment,,2025-02-03 15:35:53,"Yes, but actually no.

There are different reasons/features that people use LTN/Cybersyn for. For some of those vanilla offered arguably superior solutions for a good while (since 1.1, train limits against thundering herd problem on many-to-many schedules). For some others SA introduced solutions that are so different that they are hard to actually compare (interrupts for refueling/depots). Finally, for some yet different things, like arbitrary multi-item type trains and stations, vanilla still doesn't offer any sane options.

That's why you'll see people both proclaiming LTN/Cybersyn to be long obsolete as well as absolutely indispensable. It simply depends what you would want to use them for and thus both of those positions are right.

Last but not least - using other mods factors heavily into importance of various features. Vanilla game has relatively few intermediate products whereas many overhaul mods introduce literal hundreds if not *thousands* of them. How many item types you want your train system to handle does have huge impact on how you want it to work.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1igfx19/ltn_has_been_updated_for_factorio_20/maqpi22/,,LTN has been updated for Factorio 2.0.

post,Pushed my motorcycle through a Hackney LTN — engine off. Still fined £130. Is this legit?,2025-04-10 18:30:55,"Hey all,

I got fined in Hackney for entering an LTN zone on Richmond Road with my motorcycle. But here's the thing — **my engine was off and I was physically pushing the bike**, not riding it.

I challenged it, but Hackney rejected my appeal saying:

*“Propelling a vehicle, by any means (that includes pushing a vehicle), would be seen as non-compliance. The vehicle was being propelled at the time it was seen in contravention.""*

Has anyone else experienced this? I genuinely thought pushing it would be fine, like walking a bike through. Worth appealing to London Tribunals or am I wasting my time?

And the refueling question: Interrupts are basically exactly that. You put in the train's normal schedule, like ""pick up iron &gt; deliver iron"", and set its interrupts, such as ""if fuel is low &gt; refuel station"", or ""if not iron is in cargo &gt; deliver it elsewhere"".

post,I think 2.0 can (with one addition) replace (most of) LTN,2024-09-23 09:44:56,"EDIT: u/Flyrpotacreepugmu [pointed out below](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1fnf23g/comment/lohsysz/) that this wouldn't work. You still need a way to allow multi-requester stations to request one item but not another. If a station requests iron plates and copper plates, but is full of copper plates, you want it still to be enabled (so it can receive iron plates), but somehow not receive copper plates. You could prevent the inserters from unloading anything from a copper plate train, but then it would just sit there, occupying the slot. Maybe you could use a signal to send it away early, but that's still not ideal. So you really do need a way to control the station name by circuits.

I need to go to bed, but this idea started kicking around in my head and now it's all of your problem :)

I've been fighting with LTN in my SE run and reread the train improvement FFFs ([389](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-403), [395](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-395), and [403](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-403)) and I think they are one feature short of obviating (most of) LTN. That feature is the ability for interrupt-scheduled stops to pattern-match on the destination name to enable multi-requester stations. So you could name a station ""`[copper-plate][iron-plate] Drop`"" and set the interrupt to ""`[any-item]+ Drop`"" where the plus character behaves like in [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), matching one or more of any item. So if a train picked up some copper plates, it would still match the station ""`[copper-plate][iron-plate] Drop`"", even though there was a different item between ""`[copper-plate]`"" and "" `Drop`"".

For some context, I like creating dropoff stations like this:

[That's requesting 9 different items at the one stop](https://preview.redd.it/gtrf4mq9aiqd1.png?width=1811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c043c45fa6a6d2660569e7bf223ff965083fe5a)

This enables feats of city-block spaghetti like this:

[40 SPM of each energy science in a 128x128 tile block](https://preview.redd.it/cy8rz504biqd1.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfba3b33a3049204fa8f79afb8d1f055beedfeb8)

And I'm hoping that I can continue this madness in 2.0/SA.

So here are the different problems to solve multi-providers and multi-requesters, along with my proposed solutions in 2.0:

# Provider thresholds

Read the chest contents and use a selector combinator to get the stack size and disable the station if the number of stacks is below a threshold. If you want to have the station provide some items but not others, set inserter filters only for those items which the station is actually ready to provide.

So if a station provides both copper plates and iron plates, and it has lots of iron plates right now but few copper plates, set the inserter filter to iron plates only.

# Provide multiple items

This actually isn't that bad because of interrupts. Just dump everything into the train. Because the train chooses its interrupt destination based on its contents, you don't need to worry about only supplying the train with what it asks for. The model isn't ""create a route from A to B, picking up item X"", it's ""station A enables itself, and when a train arrives, dump whatever you have into it."" This fixes the problem of trains ending up with unexpected cargo, since they'll just route to any station which wants whatever they currently have.

# Request multiple items

This is where you would need the pattern matching thing above. A station would have a name containing all of the items it wants, and the interrupt would pattern match the station based on what it has in inventory.

# Withhold trains if no demand

This was the other big idea I had. One nice thing about LTN is that it avoids dispatching trains to providers if there aren't any requesters which want what it has. Here, I came up with two parts: buffer depots and radar-connected signals. I'll call the supply of an item above the provider threshold that doesn't have any demand the ""pending supply"". If a copper ore provider station has its buffer chests totally full, but no copper ore requester stations are currently requesting copper ore, then the network has a ""pending supply"" of copper ore, which lives in the copper ore mine station.

The key idea here is changing where pending supply lives. A ""buffer depot"" would be a station where trains go when they have pending supply. So in the example above, a train would go to the copper ore mine, pick up some copper ore, but when it tried to go to a copper ore requester, all of them would be full. This would be like the situation in ""The depot problem"" from [FFF-389](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-389). However, this interrupt would trigger only if the cargo inventory was **not** empty and while processing another interrupt (the full dropoff).

The train waits in the buffer depot until a requester for its items opens up. The buffer depot is set to a high priority, so trains will leave it first.

The final piece is that trains at the buffer depot need to tell provider station not to request trains, even if they have plenty of items. For this, I thought of reading the inventory of trains stopped at buffer depots, normalizing the value to 1 (we only care that this item exists at a buffer depot, not how much there is), and then putting that on the radar network. Provider stations, when deciding whether to enable themselves, would check the buffer depot signal and disable themselves if there is a buffer train. This way, you wouldn't have a bunch of trains loading up on copper ore if the copper plates are backed up.

# Circuitry for multi-provider stations

With all of that together, the circuitry for provider stations would look like this:

1. Chests are all wired together.
2. The total inventory gets divided by the stack size of each item (using a selector combinator).
3. If the stack size of an item is above the provide threshold, output 1. This means the station has pending supply.
4. Use an arithmetic combinator to compute `1 - each` from the radar network and multiply that by the station's pending supply. This removes any items which exist in a buffer depot.
5. Now, you have a 1 for any items which the station actually wants to provide right now, so set the inserter filters with this signal and if `anything &gt; 0`, enable the station.

This should work to make it so that you only have one (or maybe a small number) of trains in buffer depots at any time, and otherwise have provider stations stay empty until they are actually ready to fill up a train now.

# Conclusion

Maybe this idea is totally crazy, but I needed to get it out of my head. If we don't get pattern-matching interrupt names, then we could still have multi-providers, just not multi-requesters. Maybe a mod could either add pattern-matching interrupt names or (perhaps more simply) dynamically change station names based on signals.

# Note: partial loads

This system couldn't do complex partial loads, such as ""station A requests 1,000 copper plates, station B requests 2,000 copper plates, so a train going to C to pick up copper plates will only load 1,000 if it is going to A."" A train wouldn't know where it is going until it decides to depart. However, I've never needed this ability, even with the extreme levels of spaghetti in my 300+ hour (so far) SE game. You might be able to rig up something like that with the radar network, but you'd be fighting against the interrupt-push-based model of the 2.0 scheduling.",92,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1fnf23g/i_think_20_can_with_one_addition_replace_most_of/,LTN,

post,"How to share the same trains for different items, LTN style, without mods",2025-11-19 21:14:59,"Hi! I just figured this out and hadn't seen it on any tutorials, so thought I'd share:

The goal is to create ""LTN style"" trains where all trains are dynamically dispatched to any pickup, and any drop off, instead of having dedicated trains per item type.

1. set up your stations with names ""&lt;item icon&gt; load"" and ""&lt;item icon&gt; unload"". You can have as many of each as you want.
2. set up your refueling stations all with the name ""refuel"". Set going here as your train's only normal schedule
3. set up a ""unload"" interrupt: ""has cargo in inventory"" -&gt; target station ""&lt;item wildcard&gt; unload"". Lots of youtube tutorials cover this part.
4. Set up the ""pickup"" interrupt: condition is ""signal parameter"" which is the green curly wildcard. target station is ""load &lt;signal parameter&gt;"". Whenever the train receives a &lt;copper&gt; signal, it will now go to a ""load &lt;copper&gt;"" station!
5. Sending the signal: wire the chest at your unload station to a decider combinator, which will output the item if there is not enough of it. for instance, output &lt;copper&gt; if &lt;copper&gt; is less than 1k.
   1. This signal needs to reach the refueling stations to trigger the pickup interrupt! Send it through the wireless radars!
   2. But first it needs to go through a ""one way valve"" so that other signals on the radar don't come back to mess with this station. I do that with wildcard arithmetic combinator that just multiplies by 1.
6. Enabling the correct station: If you have multiple pickup stations for the same item, you'll need to keep them normally disabled, and only enable when the circuit condition is met. Just make the decider combinator also output a checkmark, and use that to enable/disable the station.

Hope this is helpful to anyone who liked LTN :)

post,Tutorial for LTN-like trains in vanilla,2025-05-07 15:54:54,"When starting SA, I was actually concerned LTN is discontinued (now it's already 2.0 ready) so I was looking for alternatives, tried few and Railway Logistics Dispatcher seemed to be promising. Eventually, I started vanilla for achievements and was all the time thinking how to do train stuff without mods. And here we are. It's possible to set up your train network only with interrupts. Totally generalized trains, only two types (for cargo and fluids). No radars, nor waits or advanced wiring. Just interrupts. And I would say it's even more effective since these mods usually uses depot station as the train's home and only updates its route when there.

Aside of common refuel, there is need for three different interrupts: Load, Unload and Depot if train is not needed.

**Setup:**

There are multiple ways how to achieve this, but let's have ALL stations that supply something to be named same name - 'Supply""/'Fluid Supply'. (If you want to identify stations or factory, you can use map tags). Let's unify ALL requesters as '\[resource icon\] Unload'. You can ofc differ station names by expected train sizes and categorize your trains accordingly. In this example, only one train size (2+4) is used. Set all station limits to 1, unless you are using waiting tracks.

[Station names with map tag](https://preview.redd.it/tlepdn0l1dze1.png?width=401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e94d103ababd6baeca63e9ee0646210de3e42a7c)

**Loading trains:**

I guess this should be pretty straightforward. If the train is empty, go to supply station and wait until full.

[Loading interrupt](https://preview.redd.it/uc2ct1cc2dze1.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6db9002b4df99c500e5708a7e8f7c9aab695ff36)

Note: You need to recreate another interrupt for fluid trains because different station name.

**Unloading trains:**

Unloading is where stuff starts to be funny. Since the train is full after loading interrupt finished, we need to check cargo type and properly select unloading station accepting loaded items. To achieve this, you'll need to set a condition with exact cargo that contains a wildcard item parameter, which is then properly propagated to a target station. You'll need to write this station name manually. Wait condition is clearly waiting for the train to be empty.

[Unloading interrupt](https://preview.redd.it/xfrqflo1qdze1.png?width=442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32a0367c5b4f3c4879ed92dce017788771099d03)

Note: You need to create another interrupt for fluid trains with wildcard fluid icon.

What will happen? When the train is full, item parameter (icon) is loaded and propagated to the target station name. The train will try to find the closest one with proper name and if there is no available, it will wait in supply station until any will be free to accept loaded cargo.

**Depot:**

Since now fine, basically you'll start filling your network with trains, but it will get eventually clogged because trains that unloaded their cargo want to go to stations supplying cargo which are occupied by trains blocked by occupied unloading stations. So, to resolve this deadlock, we want the train that doesn't have a proper target loading station to park it in the depot until it has somewhere to go.

So, firstly, setup some depot parking like this and don't forget to set trains limit to 1 for each depot station.

[Depot](https://preview.redd.it/2uuac7il4dze1.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40a342416fcd0debd461eec62cc21a1dbfe6335e)

For depot interrupt, we want to trigger it when target station is not available, and we want to trigger it only for empty trains since full has to wait in loading station otherwise your depot will be flooded with full trains and clogging whole network. Target will be depot without any waiting condition. This will lead into instantly triggering the loading interrupt after arriving into depot. Which will retrigger to depot if there is still nothing to do and since it's already sitting in depot and trains always chose the closest station, it won't do anything, just sit, and wait in the loop until some supply station becomes available.

Important: don't forget to tick checkbox allowing interrupting other interrupts.

[Depot interrupt](https://preview.redd.it/1couo6zq5dze1.png?width=435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=303fdb2f42ff1e7558a87baf6545b146adf173eb)

Note: Set some basic, e.g. 5-10s wait if having like 100+ trains to avoid constantly looping in depot&lt;&gt;load interrupts.

**Refueling tips:**

It should be easy for you to create this interrupt by yourself, but here are some optimization tips:

\- Set condition to fuel less AND empty cargo. Because if you don't tick the empty cargo, your train might get refueled full, and if target unloading will be occupied and since depot condition is only for empty trains, your train will be stuck in refueling station blocking others.

\- Set condition to fuel wildcard and set it like &lt;30. This allows you to have multiple refuel stations (useful for bigger networks) and mixed fuel types (wood/coal/solid/rocket).

\- Don't set target condition to full fuel if you use mixed fuels because obviously you will never fill those locomotives.

\- If transitioning to nuclear fuel, stop using wildcard and set condition to like nuclear fuel &lt; 2. Replace all your refuel stations with nuclear fuel and make there unloading chest for each locomotive that takes out of them everything that is no nuclear fuel.

\- Don't forget to tick interrupting for interrupts checkbox.

**Optimization tip for lowering amount of trains in the network:**

You might have noticed on the first screenshot that my unloading stations are red. They are red because they are disabled by wiring. What am I doing is disabling stations when trains cannot be unloaded. Why? Because it doesn't make sense having train sitting in supply and requester stations, so basically the idea is to limit amount of trains and overall logistics. How am I doing this? Connect all chests in requester station to train stop, calculate chests capacity, deduct train capacity and set stop to be enabled when under threshold. In this example, there are 4 wagons, each handled by 4 chests. So, chest capacity is 48 stacks by 50 (for ores) by 4 chests by 4 wagons, totalling in 38400 resources. Train capacity is then 40 stacks by 50 by 4 wagons, totalling in 8000. So, a train could properly unload if there are less than 30400 resources in the station. I've rounded down and using 30/60/120K for different stack sizes. It's kind of annoying, but since you start doing that, copy/paste eases the whole process. Also, for this, unloading cargo wagons needs to be properly balanced.

[Train stop wiring setup](https://preview.redd.it/tew363rd6dze1.png?width=193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2225b1596a5685fdbc518ebfa97506ac9aa9ef5f)

Same way, you might optimize requesters, either by enabling them or with some logic, set the number of allowed trains by remaining space in chests so they are able to fully unload. However, my experience showed, that in such case, you will still need specific amount of trains, but since they will be blocked either in loading stations or depots, you will never know the exact number. This might lead into situation that when factory production peaks, as trains prefers closest stations, they might supply only specific materials while others will be in deficiency. When not using any wires, all you need to check is that there is simply one train (per type) sitting in depot, since all loading and unloading stations should be always occupied. This way, you should always know when to add more trains.",65,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1kgxyee/tutorial_for_ltnlike_trains_in_vanilla/,LTN,

post,Hanover low traffic area,2022-09-02 17:42:29,"Has anyone else had the nonsense, misleading, appeal to ignorance flyer through their door suggesting that the low traffic neighbourhood is bad for the environment? 

I'm really enraged to be honest. The first attempt at one in the city, with actually really limited changes to the traffic flow, on roads that I cycle on and get forced to stop because ""Mr look how big my balls are"" in his car or van has to prove a point. (Even though council tax pays for roads). 

It's so sad that this presumably funded pro-car-flyer has been distributed to encourage people to ""stop the forced LTN"" that will supposedly ""destroy Hanover"" has been circulated and I worry that it will lead to lots of car owners leaving feedback and lots of non car users, pedestrians, cyclists... Parents... Not actually leaving positive feedback. 

A low traffic neighbourhood will be better for people with sensory disabilities, those that cycle and can commute to work or to the station via bike without the worry of for example half asleep drivers blasting their horn at you as they speed down a side street, for those with kids who want to stretch their legs without the constant flow of traffic. The entire point is that cars can still get to their location via a road that is built to sustain the volume of traffic. For example where is there traffic lights and crossings in Hanover? I have also done some simple searches and the idea that the traffic will continue to be higher of the routes around Hanover is debunked, people in low traffic neighbourhoods tend to embrace the change and abandon their car (to some extent)

Ultimately are you in favour of trying and maybe failing, or are you in favour of not trying and sticking with business as usual, all the while having unsafe streets for those who choose to cycle and pedestrians, having increased air pollution, increased noise pollution particularly at night with cars who have no business being in the side streets?

You have to remember that European towns and cities are old, it's easy to turn those small roads that are not accessible to cars into paths for bikes. In the US, cities are built around the idea of cars. 

NYC is progressing well in many ways about being more bike-centric but it takes a lot of work.

An interesting example of a model that could be used to replicate this is the closed street in the 90s on the east side. I forget the specific street, but it's a crosstown lane closed to traffic for one block. With this small closure, the rest of the street is naturally quieter because it's not used for through traffic. 

This is to say that you don't need a complete open street like Berry Street in order to create calmer traffic conditions.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCbike/comments/1h0ik6u/are_london_approaches_cycle_quietway_network_and/lz8gby0/,,Are London approaches (Cycle Quietway network and Low Traffic Neighborhood) feasible in NYC?
post,Moved to Canberra - impressions,2025-10-27 05:08:55,"Hi, I just moved to Canberra four weeks ago. This subreddit helped me a lot during the planning stage, reading everyone's thoughts on this, that an' the other, so to honour that, I thought I would give back as some sort of community service and share my impressions.

For context, I am in my early forties, WFH/remote (non-APS), single, no kids, moved from Perth where I lived for 20 years.

TL;DR - Canberra is OK. It's fine. It's not as good as some made it out to be, not as bad as some people feared. It's just... fine.

Why Canberra? I knew I wanted to move east, just for a change of pace post-COVID, and had finally convinced myself after about a year of to-and-fro. Don't get me wrong, I love Perth, and it's laid back way of life, which you only get from a small place that grew up too big too fast. I knew that Sydney was too chaotic, and Melbourne was no better, so like Federal politicians in the 1900's, I compromised between the two and chose Canberra. I had never visited beforehand, and learned about the place from this subreddit and the (criminally) few videos on YouTube.

Since being here, I would like to share some impressions of the place that may help others decide whether this is the place for them (please treat me kindly):

1. Canberra seems boring if you compare it to Sydney or Melbourne. Those places are 24-Hour-Party-People cities for those with more money than sense. Comparatively speaking, Canberra is a small hamlet in the mountains. Of course it's going to be boring to those fueled on coffee, box wine, and HSPs.

2. For a city of near 400K, I don't know where all the people are. Are they out on the cycleways? Nope, not there. Are they at the malls? There should be more people around, surely. Are they walking and shopping out in their neighbourhoods? Probably, but I haven't seen them. This place seems empty, except for the tourists walking across the Commonwealth bridge. I live in the Molongo Valley, and surrounded by apartments - not a peep from the neighbours... I only know people live here because I see them driving their cars. I went to IKEA out in Majura Park on a Saturday expecting lots of people, and I swear that there were more employees than customers. It looked like a closing down sale in a dilapilated suburban mall.

3. There are three types of houses in Canberra, by my reckoning: (1) Houses made in the 50s or 60s by some quirky aspiring architect, that look cold and brown. (2) Executive townhouses made especially for those APS5 and higher. (3) Tiny apartments that they built yesterday with ""bedrooms"" that can barely fit a queen size bed - maybe the cold stunts growth.

4. The weather. People talk about how cold it is in Canberra, and yes it can get cold. But no-one talks about the wind. It is windy. VERY WINDY. I am still waiting for a hot day, being from Perth that is a given, but it did get to 29 degrees last week and the BOM said ""feels like 22"" which would agree. Ask me in six months whether I want to go back to 40 degree summers in a dry heat, I might be inclined if it doesn't warm up in summer. The weather can change on a dime here, though - watch out for that.

5. I am convinced traffic doesn't exist here, and people eerily keep to the speed limit here. Why is the Tuggeranong Parkway at only 80km/h most of the time? I'm sure visitors and city dwellers who visit Canberra will think all the complaints that your commute to Civic took 20 minutes instead of 9 are quaint. Spend a Sunday morning bumper-to-bumper northbound on the Kwinana Freeway at Berrigan Drive and come back to talk to me about Canberra's traffic problems. Non-Canberrans need to get over this obsession with pointing out the number of roundabouts - for the size of the place, there are a lot. Go to any new subdivision on any city fringe and you will find just as many.

6. Infrastructure is weird here. Some areas feel like they have not had some love in a while (like Tuggeranong or Weston Creek), and some places feel... overengineered (like Molonglo Valley). Why do you have on-road cycle lanes and shared paths right beside each other? What are those weird ramps for bicycles near roundabouts? Why are your verges so wide? Want to make a lot of money in Canberra? Be a signwriter - there are too many signs that are a duplicate of another sign littered everywhere, yet the street name signs are too small to read. Get it together.

7. Someone needs to attend to your bus system urgently. The R-number buses are great, but 15 minute frequencies are too low for a rapid system. 30-minute headways for suburban routes are too slow, and they take odd out-of-the-way routes. 5-minute peak service for the Light Rail is also too slow. Bus stops in some areas are too close or too far apart to be useful. For a place with bad winters, the shelters are insufficient - but they do look cool.

8. The nature: gorgeous. I can see what they mean by 'bush capital'. I like all the trees, the rivers (even though I think there is only two that you seem to cross a million times), and all the walks around water catchment ponds that look like mini-lakes. I hope the guy/gal/other who is paid to erect the ""Warning - Swooping Birds"" signs are paid per sign. I love all the mountains. Coming from WA which is hundreds of miles of flat (no, the Darling Scarp doesn't count), all the high hills are great. My favourite: Black Mountain.

9. The layout. Sure, Central Canberra is laid out all pretty and ""planned"", makes sense (with some exceptions near Anzac Ave). The rest of the place? Utter chaos. To me, Canberra is not one combined city, but seven small cities/towns very close to one another - they just appear out of nowhere. North and South Canberra are the goody-too-shoes eldest kids that always do what Mum and Dad says, very proper and well dressed. Tuggeranong is the edgy brother who is into ska or grunge music. Woden is the wannabe influencer sister who is now getting paid well at their marketing job. Weston Creek is dripping middle child vibes. Belconnen is the sibling who went to TAFE to become a plumber and is now working too much and saving up to buy their own van. Gungahlin is the younger child who was the first to get all new things instead of hand-me-downs. Molonglo Valley is still a baby, who knows what they will end up like - spoilt most likely.

To sum up, Canberra is an all-right kind of city. It's quiet, laid back, rugged up, insular, with expectations to do more because it is the capital city.... but doesn't really want to. I'm sure they look at Goulbourn or Queanbeyan with slight envy, sighing ""I remember when life used to be that simple"". In saying all that, I'm starting to like it here, and I don't know how I feel about that.

Thank you for your indulgence.",141,https://www.reddit.com/r/canberra/comments/1oh4ync/moved_to_canberra_impressions/,low traffic neighbourhood,
comment,,2025-10-27 06:03:18,"I’ve lived here for 50 years, less some time spent living in Darwin and Switzerland. I reckon this is a pretty fair assessment. 

1. I love big cities. But I’ve come to realise they’re great if you’re either a tourist or have the income to live right in the middle of the action if you live in the suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney then you never see the action anyway. 

2. You’ve already identified the dispersed nature of the design. This means people don’t all congregate in a CBD. But I also feel that people tend to isolate in their suburban privacy - definitely less people out and about. But high density developments are changing that. 

3. If you’re luck like us you can find a gem. Three bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms and double garage with no garden right next to a town centre!

4. Spring is really the windy period so maybe your experience is just timing. I always say that summer in Canberra is so hot (we can easily get a week or two of 35+) that you can’t believe you’ll ever be cold again. But then winter (-7) is so cold that you can’t believe you’ll ever be hot again. Bear in mind our hottest temperatures are in January and it will be very dry - I notice the change in humidity just driving to Sydney. 

5. I think traffic has decreased since WFH became a thing. The car park across the road from my building always has spaces where once upon a time you needed to get in early. 

7. Public transport will always suffer from the dispersed design. I’m a big fan, and proper investment could improve it (eg. Some of the rapid routes are anything but!). 

8. I try to head out every weekend I’m in Canberra to go for a walk. You can’t go wrong with any part of town. 

9. The dispersed design is both a blessing a curse. Now that we live in a relative new place in a town centre, it’s fantastic. Everyone I need to - office, public transport, shops, restaurants, cinema, health, gyms - is within a 15 minutes walk.

The letter just arrived and there could be possibly 4 more on the way as they used the route 3 times in 1 week (there and back). 
Will the council offer any leniency if they pay the first one and appeal the others as they were un aware of the zones.
Otherwise they will be taking £65 * 6 = £390 off a student who recently bought a car during the cost of living crisis for a simple mistake...

post,Nottingham tram extension proposal:,2025-07-15 12:55:38,"In 2004, after deciding it was the best way to curb traffic in the city, Nottingham reintroduced its trams. Currently the system has 2 lines and stretches into nearby towns like Beeston, which I think is its best asset. The main problem is it’s mainly along the west of Nottingham despite east Nottingham being slightly bigger.

To counteract this, I would increase the network by 4 lines, all focusing on neighbourhoods in Nottingham itself such as Arnold, West Bridgeford and Carlton. The only town outside of Nottingham served by these lines would be Ilkeston due to being located directly west.



As for the existing green lines, I would extend 3 of them to more nearby towns despite them all having train stations, since each of these towns have populations between 50,000 - 100,000 and are all part of Nottingham’s urban area but quite low rail service. These extensions would be:

Phoenix park to Heanor

Toton to Long Eaton

And finally, a complete takeover of trams on the line to Hucknall and on to Mansfield so that it can be double track the whole way. This also would allow more of Mansfield to be served by rail transit along with Kirkby and Sutton. An existing line via Pinxton can be used for mainline train services to Mansfield.

These far out tram lines would allow a massive increase in rail service in the region without having to open more train stations. Nottingham station is quite small and its surface level can’t be expanded so increasing train services can only really be done if a tunnel is dug under the city, another project I would like to see.



One extension that despite being proposed, I wouldn’t do is to Derby. I think the town should have its own tram network and the rail corridor between the two cities should be improved. I’m aware it’s nearer to Nottingham than Mansfield but it’s almost 3 times the size. Mansfield only needs 1 tram line and part of the current line to Mansfield has a parallel tram so far so just extend it the full way. The tram extension to Derby would have to be built from scratch along the A52 near towns on the railway which could just have their stations reopened.",157,https://www.reddit.com/r/nottingham/comments/1m0eo0p/nottingham_tram_extension_proposal/,low traffic neighbourhood,

post,How do you feel about Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in your borough?,2020-09-09 11:47:44,"So LTN's are popping up around London. 

The point is that they are supposed to reduce the dominance of cars in residential areas and allow journeys to be more easily made via cycling, walking and public transport. There are many places in London where they have existed for decades but it's argued that GPS, increasing numbers of cars, increasing numbers of cyclists and the need for physical distancing has made it more urgent.

However as a result some car journeys may be longer and there are claims that traffic and pollution is made worse on main roads - where people also live.

There is also large scale opposition from many black taxi drivers who are accustomed to using back streets to avoid traffic which may no longer be possible.

What's your view and it would be good to know how you travel around London?

Since then I've seen Labour councillors and other Labour leaning people use the same kind of rhetoric. We have stoked the fire and are going to get our fingers burnt. Again.

Farage (and those like him) have been quick to jump on this bandwagon. Just like other parts of the 'culture wars' LTNs are wedge issues that can be used to emotionally garner support. Falling into line with their rhetoric will not give transfer the support to us - all it does is strengthen the support in the other direction.

comment,,2020-12-08 11:27:19,"Cyclists are sadly an easy target, even though the vast majority do nothing wrong. I've yet to speak to someone who talks about how cyclists believe they are above the law and is able to say that they have never broken the speed limit, let alone ran ambers, parked illegally etc. Can't go out in my car without seeing multiple cases of dangerous driving or parking, yet there's no outrage there.

Unfortunately, it is borne out in our justice system too. If you're going to kill someone, you're better off doing so with a car. Even better if your victim is on a bike. Some of the sentences are stupidly lenient and yet the public still show sympathy towards the driver. Was some talk about increasing the punishment for causing death by dangerous driving, but I'm not sure that will achieve much when the CPS so regularly accept a guilty plea for death by careless driving, even in cases which are close to being a slam dunk.

[Just look at this case.](https://road.cc/content/news/driver-who-ran-over-cyclist-purpose-jailed-12-months-279287) Deliberately drive into a cyclists with what is basically a particularly deadly weapon, break both his legs and punch him while down and you'll only get 12 months, possibly out in 6...

post,"Trip report: Santiago, Chile 🇨🇱 - unfortunately, a no. ",2024-11-24 23:12:07,"I just spent two weeks working from Santiago, Chile, and as a base for remote work, it didn’t deliver enough for me to give it a compelling recommendation.

For context, I’m currently on a three-month stint working through various South American cities, starting with a month in [Bogotá](https://www.holdall.work/destinations/bogota), a week in [Medellín](https://www.holdall.work/destinations/medellin), and then two weeks in [Lima](https://www.holdall.work/destinations/lima).

***I don’t want to write it off entirely as a city, but when considering all the places on the continent—or even the world—where you could spend an extended period working, I’d rank it fairly low on the list.***



# 👎 Negatives

* **One of the most disappointing cities for food I can recall visiting.** Finding a tasty, quick, and inexpensive meal in Santiago was laborious. Chile is not a country renowned for its food, and both Peruvian and Chinese restaurants far outweighed any domestically focused outlets. Whilst the Peruvian places felt of similar quality to what you might find in Lima (if not twice the price), the Chinese restaurants were sorely lacking. There are, of course, great quality higher-end options for both local and international cuisine. But as I reflect on the two weeks, I can't recall having spent so long in a destination and failing to make any sort of connection with the food. Local staples like empanadas appeared anaemic and undercooked, while pastries and other baked goods were generally of low quality by international standards. Street food is practically non-existent, aside from a few men hauling charred meat of unknown origin on makeshift BBQs and offering some rather unappealing sandwiches.
* **The metro makes for an unpleasant morning commute.** At the risk of sounding over-dramatic, I can't recall a metro system where I ever felt so confident I could catch an illness from just momentarily setting foot in a carriage. Even at an early hour, the trains are frequently close to full capacity. Most journeys see passengers continuously jostling for space, accompanied by a soundtrack of ill-sounding coughs and music blasting from phones. Your morning commute would be best planned by avoiding it if at all possible. **‍**
* **The cities layout failed to inspire.** Structurally, I found the layout of the city underwhelming. Assuming you'll avoid the historical centre, many activity hubs are located next to arterial roads rather than being hubs in themselves. The metro has good coverage but fails to extend deep into both Vitacura and Las Condes which can make accessing parts of these more troublesome than you would expect.
* **Many items felt like bad value for money.** Whilst higher costs are to be expected in Chile, some items felt disproportionately high. In Starbucks a double espresso can cost 4,800 pesos (nearly £4). A simple meal in an unassuming, rustic, humble restaurant in the historical centre can cost up to 13,000 pesos (£10). Whilst these may not seem extreme in isolation, considering the median income in the country is dramatically lower than the say UK, it doesn't quite add up. If you are planning on eating out for most meals, it adds up over a sustained period.
* **Extortionate ATM fees.** I couldn't find anywhere which would charge less than £9 to withdraw cash from an ATM, so went the duration of the trip without doing so. Having said that, given the near-universal acceptance of card payments and few items of interest available from the street, you can easily go without. Scotiabank ATMs are reportedly fee-free but I failed to find a functioning outlet on the ground. 

# 👍 Positives

* **The Andes provide a spectacular backdrop to the city.** The mountain peaks are often masked by a heavy haze of smog and mist throughout the day, but their sporadic appearance makes for a captivating view which looks as impressive as the photos.**‍**
* **Incredibly convenient access to hiking.** Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons to visit Santiago is to immerse yourself in some of the spectacular nature that can be found on its doorstep. From an hour-long hike up Cerro San Cristóbal to potential multi-day expeditions into the Andes, you don't have to plan too hard to find some great routes.
* **A strong wine culture.** Wine fans will be in for a treat, with great-quality domestic wine freely available in bars and restaurants across the city. Expect to pay around 5,000 pesos for a glass (£4) in a nice establishment, with bottles costing less from a supermarket. Look out for some rarer locally grown varieties such as Carménère and Carignan making an appearance on menus.
* **Some of the best infrastructure in the region.** The city's expansive metro lines make it easy to navigate what can be a large urban expanse, with trains running up to every two minutes during peak hours. These are complemented by a series of concealed subterranean tunnels which carry a lot of the city's road traffic, making east-west travel easier than it would otherwise be.
* **Ideal weather.** The weather was close to perfect throughout the duration of my stay in November, a typically dry period with warm days and characteristically clear blue skies, giving way to cool night-time breezes.
* **High levels of safety by Latin American standards.** Whilst my two-week experience can't serve as a universal truth, Santiago felt significantly safer than both Medellín and Bogotá. Although there are areas you would want to avoid in the city, you can roam the neighbourhoods of Providencia, Las Condes, and Vitacura with a level of freedom similar to that in [Europe.Like](http://Europe.Like) in any major city, keep an eye on your phone and follow standard safety protocols.

[Arguably the best thing about Santiago is how easy it is to access great hiking trails. Within a 20-minute Uber ride, you can be at the start of a variety of trails with something suitable for all abilities. The landscape is a mix of mountains and semi-arid deserts, with cacti vastly outnumbering any trees. A huge benefit to have on your doorstep.](https://preview.redd.it/d66ylr8r9x2e1.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9aea26404e5df72b0806ec37d39f339cb58a458)

[Whilst the metro is undoubtedly a huge asset to Santiago, it is prone to severe overcrowding during peak hours. If you are attempting to board a Línea 1 train between 07:00 and 09:00, you can easily watch seven trains pass with only sufficient space for a single passenger to board or disembark each time. It is easily the most uncomfortable commute I've experienced.](https://preview.redd.it/40pecj6t9x2e1.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dce7cf7a1de72ef4409eaf49f94d4f7d72aa98df)



# 📋 Tips

* **Pick up a Bip! card to use public transport across the city.** The cards can be bought and reloaded at any metro station. I had issues using Apple Pay to purchase the card, so I suggest bringing a physical card to use in the station terminals when initially purchasing or topping up. Not all stationas appear to have machines which dispensed cards but I had success at the [Plaza de Armas L3 station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YccyeSDasRMSD9Qt9).
* **An Airalo eSIM was good value.** A 20GB data and voice plan cost $23 USD which, whilst more expensive than local offerings, saved time navigating the seemingly enormous queues in Movistar outlets.
* **Ubers are available from the second floor in the airport.** They don't appear to be able to pick up from the airport, but I had no problems getting one from the arrivals area, with a journey to the downtown area costing 16,000 CLP (£13). You may see out-of-date information online that the service is illegal in the country; however, in recent years it has become fully legalised and works flawlessly.
* **Bring some warm clothes for the evenings even in summer.** Even on days when the temperatures reach up to 30°C, it can drop dramatically during the evenings and early mornings.
* **Sundays are a great time to explore the city by bike or on foot.** Like other South American cities, large portions of the city's roads are closed for the Ciclovía. The area around the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes is particularly popular with people making the most of the freedom.**‍**
* **Tipping felt less transparent.** Chile shares a similar tipping culture to Colombia via the addition of a voluntary propina (10%). However, while in Bogotá there was an explicit ask of it on each transaction, in Santiago there were occasions where an effort was made to conceal the request. I couldn't quite work out if this was a general cultural trend or perhaps an attempt to take advantage of a foreigner's naivety, but there was a noticeably different dynamic.



[A view from the 22nd floor of the WeWork on Av. Apoquindo looking across Las Condes towards the Andes. Even in mid-November, there's still snow covering the peaks of the mountains in the distance.](https://preview.redd.it/ms09es61ax2e1.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=152e367a57bc79fcaf20377a2d060b3bb0d6af93)

[Over the weekends, the absence of the working population means large portions of the historical centre take on a somewhat post-apocalyptic, desolate feel, with mounds of rubbish frequently lining the streets. Whilst it never felt unsafe, your weekends are best spent elsewhere..](https://preview.redd.it/jbmw0fo2ax2e1.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e3a9f05fa01f426de1bb46d5f0df70886a505fe)





# 🖥️ Where to work

There are a reasonable number of coworking options across Santiago, with most of the quality options concentrated close to the [Tobalaba](https://maps.app.goo.gl/piPPJLCgxgvkHuJ47) station in Providencia.

**WeWork** has only one remaining site in the city, immediately outside [Manquehue metro station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jQhWsoL5sr9pU88a9), which makes it a fair distance from the city centre and a commute you'd be best avoiding.

The main All Access space is on the 22nd floor where there is a large quiet area for focused work, several phone booths, and two large outdoor patios with soft furnishings under the shade. Being so high gives you incredible views with the Andes peering into the distance further East and the core of the city further down to the West.

The main reason I would suggest ***not*** working from there is a catastrophically bad offering of food and drink in the immediate area. Whilst there is a cafe on the 22nd floor, it serves an unappealing range of microwaveable burgers, small cakes and Starbucks coffee. There are some more offerings further back towards the commercial buildings near Rosario Norte, but they are too far to be frequently walked during the working day.

If you're only passing through Santiago for a few nights and don't want to sign up to anywhere, you may want to consider using the [Santander 'Work Cafés'.](https://www.santander.com/es/stories/work-cafe-el-innovador-concepto-de-oficina-bancaria-del-santander#:~:text=A%20simple%20vista%20puede%20parecer,empresas%20de%20una%20manera%20diferente.) These bank branches have dedicated coworking spaces installed and offer facilities comparable to dedicated commercial venues. I visited several throughout the city and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the interiors. I'd suggest trying one outside the Centro Histórico, where you can expect to find a more professional and less 'ambient' working environment. They are generally open from 09:00 - 17:00, closing earlier on Fridays.

Speciality coffee shops aren't as abundant in Santiago as you may find elsewhere - Starbucks have a heavy presence across the city and can make for a viable short term option with most open until 20:00.





# ⚠️ Safety

* **I walked extensively around much of Santiago and found little cause for concern.** Compared to my previous South American destinations, Santiago proved comfortably the easiest city for exploring on foot. With late sunsets (20:00 in November), you have plenty of daylight hours for exploration.
* **The Centro Histórico, while rough in patches, feels surprisingly secure.** During weekdays, the large working population keeps the area bustling until late into the evening. Weekends bring quieter streets which feel more eerie than threatening. I'd avoid walking through Mercado Central and the surrounding streets after dusk, as it took a notably seedier feeling in the late evenings. The lower half of the area closer to the Estacion Universidad de Chile station is in general a lot better. It's a much more viable option than either of the La Candelaria areas in Medellín or Bogotá.
* **Bellavista has a reputation for night time safety issues.** If visiting for nightlife, use Uber for travel to and from the area. There didn't feel anything to be concerned about during the daytime.
* **The Metro runs efficiently and securely.** The seemingly never ending flow of passengers on main lines and security guards on the platforms means there's always a healthy presence of people across the system.
* **Cerro San Cristóbal is super popular on weekends.** Join the crowds of locals walking up if you are hesitant about going up their alone. Again, a much safer option than the equivalent city hikes in Colombia.
* **Caution should be taken if visiting Valparaíso.** The coastal city is a popular day trip from Santiago but in recent years has had a reputation for being less secure with several dangerous areas. I didn't make it on this occasion but the security situation sounded worse than what you may find in the centre of Santiago.





# 🥾 Hikes to recommend

[**Cerro Manquehue**](https://www.strava.com/activities/12957910167/overview?utm_medium=web_embed&amp;utm_source=activity_embed&amp;strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Factivities%2F12957910167&amp;_branch_match_id=1227197644571631378&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3WOvQ6CMBSFn6aMIlRBTIgxGiZX56YtF2mgFG8LxMVntwhxM7nLuV%2FOT%2B1cb49haB3ykW94329a1TWhvCl%2B5wdqn%2BJE4l3F21Zw2bAB27yePYSeSVz4W53SaC%2B4dGpUToH1IoqzfZpF2yhJvTIj4KhgIrQYnGYaSjVoQq8TCAZaQEniZAbWDCjBgzXrtdBg6WElQD8v%2FC5Zfr8p%2F9qDN0IFiKp7MIFmsoD5pUaj4QPyKopv%2FwAAAA%3D%3D)

Take an Uber to the trailhead on Vía Roja, where you can take a path leading you up to Manquehue or the shorter Manquehuito slightly to the east. It's a steep climb to the summit along a path with numerous loose stones, offering panoramic views across the city below. Instead of returning to the trailhead, you can traverse over the top to finish in Los Trapenses, though this involves a considerable return journey to the city. No entrance ticket required.

[**Parque Natural Aguas de Ramón**](https://www.strava.com/activities/12915118674/overview?utm_medium=web_embed&amp;utm_source=activity_embed&amp;strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Factivities%2F12915118674&amp;_branch_match_id=1227197644571631378&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3WOyw6CMBBFv6YsITxENCHGaFi5dd20ZZCGluK0QNz47RYh7kxmc%2BfkPlrnBnuMIuuQTSxkwxAq2XeRuEl2Z0Vqn%2FxEkqxhSnEmOjqiKtvFQ9IzSSp%2Fm1MY7QUTTk7SSbBexMkh3sVxke8zr8wEOEmYSVqNTlMNtRw1Sa8zcAqaQ02SfAHWjCjAgy3rtdJg7aE1wLAs%2FC5Zf78p%2F9qDN0IDiLJ%2FUI5mtoDlpUWj4QOzPXVz%2FwAAAA%3D%3D)

It's worth taking an Uber to the entrance of this natural park, around a 30-minute drive from the Centro Histórico. There are a variety of well-marked trails traversing a stream running through the foothills of the Andes, with the trail concluding at some waterfalls. Plan for 5 hours up and down. Book a ticket in advance (3,500 pesos) from the website to avoid queuing on arrival. You will be asked for your ID number but you do not need to bring the physical document with you.

[**Santa Lucia Hill &amp; Cerro San Cristobal**](https://www.strava.com/activities/12870968949/overview?utm_medium=web_embed&amp;utm_source=activity_embed&amp;strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Factivities%2F12870968949&amp;_branch_match_id=1227197644571631378&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3WOvQ6CMBSFn6aMoEAQTIgxGiZX56YtF2loKd4WiIvPbhHiZnKXc7%2Bcn9a5wR6jyDpkEwvZMIRK9l0kbpLdWZ7YJz%2BROG2YUpyJjo6oynbxkORM4srf5hRGe8GEk5N0EqwX%2Bzg%2F7IosL9LCKzMBThJmklSj01RDLUdNkusMnILmUJM4W4A1IwrwYMt6rTRYe2gNMCwLv0vW32%2FKv%2FbgjdAAouwflKOZLWB5adFo%2BACxndcB%2FwAAAA%3D%3D)

If you're out for a day of exploring, it's worth combining these two sites. I'd suggest visiting at the weekend when you'll be joined by hundreds of others heading up San Cristóbal Hill, which is part of the Parque Metropolitano de Santiago. If you fancy a hike, you can carry on further, with plenty of walking and cycling trails eventually looping back to Vitacura. No ticket required





# ☕️ Food &amp; drink

[**Singular Coffee Roasters**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GefKrd9oMHvU15UQ9)

Small chain with a number of outlets dotted across the city, offering some of the best coffee I sampled in Santiago. Both this and the Providencia site have limited seating and are more geared towards takeaway.

[**Baco**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8WVMYGGT6KUxYkhy8)

A well-styled yet casual-feeling French bistro-styled restaurant - a great place to sample a range of Chilean wines with an extensive wine list available by the glass.

[**La Loncheria** ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hYMSXQx7A3pAUJD68)

I found good food hard to come by in the historical center but this place is a great place to sample a traditional Chilean sandwich. Could happily recommend the Churrasco Italiano, consisting of fried steak, avocado, tomato and plentiful mayonnaise.





# 🏠 Neighbourhoods

The size of Santiago can be deceptive at first glance of a map.

The city's more upmarket and desirable neighbourhoods lie north-east of the traditional downtown area, and due it's size, you should think carefully about where you plan to work from.



✅ [Providencia](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-33.426627,-70.60925&amp;z=12&amp;t=m&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=US&amp;mapclient=embed&amp;q=Providencia%20Santiago%20Metropolitan%20Region%20Chile)

What felt like the best bet for a prolonged stay. A much more contemporary feeling area of the city, with plenty of speciality coffee shops and higher-end bars and dining options. I'd aim to be close to Avenida Providencia between Manuel Montt and Tobalaba metro stations to give convenient access to the Línea 1 metro line.



✅ [Lastarria](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-33.439092,-70.640647&amp;z=15&amp;t=m&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=US&amp;mapclient=embed&amp;q=Lastarria%20Santiago%20Santiago%20Metropolitan%20Region%20Chile)

An ideal option if in town for a couple of days and wanting to be nearer the Centro Histórico. Lastarria is nestled immediately to the east and has a much more refined selection of options for eating and dining. Expect to hear lots of North American accents. Not somewhere I would opt for in the long term due to how tourist orientated it felt.



❌ [Centro Histórico](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=-33.437204,-70.649848&amp;z=13&amp;t=m&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=US&amp;mapclient=embed&amp;q=Centro+Historico+8320138+Santiago+Santiago+Metropolitan+Region+Chile)

Where I regrettably stayed most recently. Worth visiting during the week when it's a bustling commercial hub, but during weekends, large swathes of it feel like an abandoned ghost town. There's a notable lack of modern dining options, with the culinary scene mainly comprised of highly localised interpretations of Chinese food. The area north of Plaza de Armas can feel particularly unsavoury, and it's unlikely this is an area any visitor would want to call home for an extended period.



❌ Las Condes / Vitacura

These huge neighbourhoods are considered some of the safest residential districts within Santiago. Whilst they may make sense as permanent places to live, they felt too disconnected from the core of the city for a short stay. Assuming you won't have a car, unless you're staying close to one of the metro stations on Av. Apoquindo, you'll likely be highly reliant on Ubers to get about.



❌[ Bellavista](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-33.432014,-70.638395&amp;z=13&amp;t=m&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=US&amp;mapclient=embed&amp;q=Bellavista%208420436%20Recoleta%20Santiago%20Metropolitan%20Region%20Chile)

A small hub just north of the Centro Histórico with a range of galleries, restaurants and options for nightlife. It felt fine walking on foot during the day but is reportedly unsafe at night. Probably worth avoiding on your first visit to the city but enjoyable to visit during the day.

**In summary:** As a city to base yourself for remote work, it fell short for me in several key areas. It's worth stopping by for a few nights as a base to explore the rest of Chile, or if you're already in the region.

* Respondents overwhelmingly agreed that the government should act in local neighbourhoods to increase road safety (88%), improve air quality (86%), reduce traffic congestion (83%) and reduce traffic noise (75%).
* Support varied by subgroup. However, respondents were consistently more likely to agree than disagree with interventions across subgroups, with pedestrians and cyclists more likely than car/van drivers to agree to government intervention, and 16-24 year olds least likely to agree than other age groups.
* Three quarters of respondents supported the reduction of road traffic in towns and cities in England (77%) and their local area / neighbourhood (78%), and two thirds of respondents were supportive of reallocating road space to walking and cycling across towns and cities in England (66%) and their local area / neighbourhood (65%).
* Support for reducing road traffic across national and local areas was significantly higher than support for reallocating road space to walking and cycling, although both received high levels of support of two-thirds or more.
* Support also varied by subgroup, but all subgroups were consistently more likely to support, rather than oppose, reducing road traffic and reallocating road space to walking and cycling. Cyclists, pedestrians and those who rent, live in social or other types of housing where among the subgroups who were the most supportive; car/van drivers and homeowners were among the least supportive.
* The four areas considered to be the most serious problems in residential and high streets were: vehicles going too fast (30% residential, 26% high street), not enough car parking spaces (27% residential, 26% high street), heavy traffic (20% residential, 23% high street) and traffic fumes (20% residential, 24% high street). Apart from vehicles going too fast and not enough car parking spaces, all other problem areas were seen to be a more serious problem in local high streets than residential streets.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oxr3e4/public_attitudes_towards_traffic_road_use_and/h7o1kxa/,,"Public attitudes towards traffic, road use and low-traffic neighbourhoods | DfT research and analysis"

Sure, we'd all like to make it so we need cars less. But the only way you're reducing cars in towns is building more roads/infrastructure around them.

post,Low Traffic Neighbourhood trials suspended - Wandsworth,2020-09-11 18:39:31,"Wandsworth Council is to suspend its Low Traffic Neighbourhood (LTN) trials following a high level review.

The LTN trials were introduced last month to make residential streets more bike and pedestrian friendly and to deter rat run traffic.  


They were part of a series of measures introduced as part of the COVID response by freeing up additional space on the highway in support of social distancing and to promote alternative forms of travel as people gradually return to work.

The trials also supported the council’s ambition of combating climate change by encouraging people to use more sustainable forms of transport and tackling air quality.

However an initial review of the trials has identified concerns with emergency access and traffic flows. And this has been compounded by additional changes that Transport for London (TfL) is making to red route roads in the borough.  


These include significant interventions on the A24 (Balham High Road to Tooting High Street and beyond) including moving bus stops, installing cycle lane segregation, banning turns at a number of junctions and removing parking.

The scale of these A24 changes coinciding with the council’s efforts to establish LTNs on residential streets has caused confusion and long traffic queues.

Additionally, concerns around rising COVID rates and reduced capacity on public transport has meant that alternative travel options are limited for many people at this time.

In light of these initial trial findings the council has decided to suspend the LTN trials.

Wandsworth Council’s cabinet member for strategic planning and transportation, Cllr John Locker said: “We have monitored the traffic flows and listened to feedback from residents and businesses. We have also spoken to our partners including local hospitals and key services to hear the impact on them.

“It is clear that the LTNs are not delivering the benefits we want to see. In fact it looks like the combination of changes in areas like Tooting, where TfL are making changes to the main high road, are unfortunately having the opposite effect. That is why we have taken the difficult decision to pause and re-think about how we can achieve our objective of delivering healthier, safer streets.”

He added: “We all want to do what is right environmentally, whilst maintaining people’s ability to travel and making sure town centres and high streets function properly. It’s important that we listen to what people are saying so that we get this right.”

The Council will continue to review the impact of TfL’s road changes to the A24 in Balham and Tooting to see if the issues improve over the coming weeks.

comment,,2020-09-12 10:53:03,"It's easy to get consultation responses from noisy minorities. Motorists and cyclists can sometimes indentify very strongly with their mode of transport. Pedestrians? Not so much. Children who can't safely walk to school, who can't play in their street, are they going to up and form a local campaigning organisation to represent their interests? Of course not. But they are hugely affected by the dominance of motor traffic.

I do think that it's up to councils to weather any initial angry response and show leadership - particularly if they were elected on manifestos which stated they would encourage walking and cycling. They shouldn't judge the response by how busy their inbox is now, but by how busy it is once everyone has got used to the changes. I bet councillors in Hackney never get emails asking them to rip out bollards put in place back in the 70s, put it that way...

edit - re the mention of manifestos, [this snippet](https://twitter.com/Jo_Earlsfield/status/1304699461046882304) from the Wandsworth Tories' election material in 2018 is interesting.

If the overall capacity of the road network goes down, then less people will drive. Before you say that people need to drive, many people only do so because it's convenient (like a 5 mins drive to the shops for milk, or driving 15 mins to work.). 

This also works in reverse - open a nice new road like a town bypass and you'll get more people taking more journeys as it's suddenly convenient.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/z5jis6/low_traffic_neighbourhood_schemes_cut_air/ixy1o4x/,,Low traffic neighbourhood schemes cut air pollution on nearby roads | New Scientist

All of the people on the Facebook group are losing their shit. Some justifying it. In general the people who have cars have opposed this since the start, but theyre the ones clogging up the road and creating pollution by driving a car for short journeys.

Obviously throwaway, I don’t need anyone here seeing my regular account. Also I’m in the US and English is my first language, any discrepancies are because I suck at typing on my phone.

So TL/DR for the “give me the bare bones, I don’t have all day to read on the shitter” crew: My #1 sex rule since high school has been no sex before the third date. I recently broke that rule with a handicapped guy, and now my childhood best friend is pissed and grossed out because she thinks I have some weird kind of fetish.

Context/full story: I’m a 28f. My childhood best friend we’ll call Jess is also 28f. To put it simply, I don’t think I’m any kind of prude, I just don’t really feel comfortable with casual sex, never have. My best friend knows this and has teased me about it lightly in the past. She’s been in a long term relationship for the last 3 years, I’ve mostly been single while working on my degree and starting my career. Jess lives in another state with her boyfriend, so we don’t hang out much anymore.

So about a month ago I had a first date with a guy I’d been talking to for a bit, thought it was going places, but he gave a WEIRD vibe on the date and I cut and ran early. On my way home I stopped at a local pub, figured I’d have a drink to unwind and people watch till it wore off. (Tipsy driving is still drunk driving IMO.) I get there and it’s pretty packed, Friday night and all, and there was no seating room at the bar. Took my drink and looked around, most of the “restaurant” side of the pub was someone’s birthday party, but there was a small table with a seat open off to the side, with a guy reading a book there. So I say eff it, I’m a social person and what’s the worst thing that happens, he says no? So I ask if I can sit there for a bit, I promise we don’t have to talk or anything.

At this point I feel like I’ve fucked up because this guy up close is *the hottest man I have ever seen*. But he just smiled at me and gave an enthusiastic “Sure!” A few minutes later of me sipping in silence and he says “I don’t mind talking, if you want to.” (Yeah I want to are you kidding me right now?) We talk for a bit and it turns out Mike (fake name) is 29, just finished his master’s degree in some kind of computer learning field (“I program computers to program computers”) and he’s living on his own for the first time. He apparently stops by the pub after work because he’s right around the corner, and he’s not used to the silence yet after living so long with a half dozen siblings.

We talked for a good two hours, about everything from dating (which he said he’s basically given up on) to hobbies and tastes, and we have a near total eclipse of a venn diagram on this stuff. I eventually sort of blurted out that I don’t know why he’d give up on dating, this is the closest thing I’ve had to a good date in forever. (Shooting my shot obliquely here lol.) He gets kind of an odd look on his face and says “Tell you what, I have to go to the bathroom, but when I come back I’ll ask you out for real.” Weird, but okay?

Then it all clicks, because he doesn’t get up to walk away, he just rolls. In his wheelchair. And I’m thinking “oh my God he wanted to give me a chance to back out of this without making it awkward how cute can this guy BE.” He grinned like crazy when he got back and saw I was still there, and I basically tripped over myself saying something to the effect of “So I’m free all weekend, what did you have in mind?”

Another hour later, we’ve got plans for Saturday, and he told me he has a neuromuscular disorder I can’t remember the name of (my degree isn’t in STEM lol) so his legs work, but the signals from his brain get misinterpreted so he doesn’t have the balance or coordination for walking or standing. The pub starts switching over to the younger/rowdier crowd and he asks if I’d like to go back to his place for coffee to continue our conversation.

As you have probably long since realized, I did not get any coffee or conversation till the next morning and I have ZERO regrets. We’ve been dating since and I know it’s still early but I really feel like this might be the one.

Onward to yesterday afternoon, my friend Jess (remember Jess?) is in town, and we go out for coffee to catch up on things. I’m gushing about Mike, but when I get to how we met she just sort of got weird and edgy. I don’t remember any exact words but she essentially said that I must have a fetish for the handicapped since I broke my #1 rule and it’s the best physical relationship I’ve ever been in. Like it’s good for me because he uses a wheelchair, not because the guy puts in effort in bed??? She said I’ve “changed” as a person and left without even saying goodbye. 15 years of friendship and I’ve never seen her like that.

So here I am, asking the most objective people online (haha) if I’m an asshole or weird for being super attracted to a guy who uses a wheelchair and basically putting out immediately.

[\[UPDATE\] AITAH For breaking my Number 1 sex rule with a handicapped guy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1c85ds3/update_aitah_for_breaking_my_number_1_sex_rule/?share_id=i5gwYUdrRGHwS4iwfHXqr&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1) - April 29, 2024

My first ever update! Yay! Uh, so if you were hoping for some terrible drama, I hate to break it to you that I don’t roll like that. No pun intended. So I do have an update on Jess and shit finally makes perfect sense. And I have a slightly NSFW but funny story about Mike, because this guy is just the best, y’all.

Okay, so first, I finally messaged Jess yesterday and said basically “I’m still hurt by what you said, but after 15 years of friendship I’d never forgive musif I didn’t at least ask why you snapped at me like that.” She replied immediately, “I’m so fucking sorry, I didn’t mean any of that, can we have a do over on lunch?” So I agreed cautiously and took a half day to meet with her today.

Turns out that those of you who said she was jealous, and that she might have something else going on, and especially the person who said something might be going on in HER relationship….. gold stars. She’s in town because she’s job hunting, because she’s moving back in with her parents for a while since her relationship ended. Apparently they have been having a ton of small problems adding up, but the biggest one? Sex. The guy she’s been with was apparently never great but it’s gotten to the point where he makes no effort at all for her to enjoy herself and then gets pissed when she isn’t in the mood. She tried talking with him about it, making suggestions but he told her recently that it’s “emasculating” being given sex advice by a woman. The straw that broke the metaphorical camel’s back, however, was that her boyfriend has always had a thing for Asian women. She’s caucasian, but she does have long black hair. After weeks of fighting over their sex life, he suggested that they spice things up….by her dressing in a kimono and pretending to be Asian. She lost it on him and is absolutely disgusted by the racist fetishism and ended it right then.

So she had allllll of this bottled up and was hoping to talk to me and finally be able to put it down….. and I missed every hint that she had something big to discuss because I was gushing about Mike. So to her it felt like I was just twisting the knife by bragging about how great our sex was. She snapped, and somewhere between what I was saying and what she wanted to talk about some wires got crossed and she said something incredibly dumb. She left without saying goodbye because she was mortified and ashamed as well as irrationally mad at me. Something to know about Jess, she’s an awful liar and she and I were the co-founders of our high school’s “foot-in-mouth” society, so I do believe her. I told her I forgive her and I’m sorry I didn’t realize she wanted to talk about something bothering her, and she said I was too stupidly nice and have nothing to apologize for, so I think we’ll be okay. For the time being I’m not ready for her and Mike to meet, because I don’t want to make things feel worse, and she agrees. But she’s really really happy for me. Hopefully this is just a funny story we can look back on someday.

So, on to how Mike almost killed me, lol. Last night we were talking about the reddit post and he gets this funny expression that I’m starting to recognize. And he goes “How do we know you don’t have a fetish if we haven’t at least tried it in the chair?” And I’m like “are you serious lol”. He said he’s never attempted it, because (cue tears) he’s never felt so comfortable with a partner before. Well.

His chair has what is essentially like a parking break thing. Or it should, it’s unfortunately broken and apparently getting them fixed is an expensive pain in the ass. He doesn’t use it that often so he hasn’t made it a priority. And there’s this thing called Newton’s third law, you know how every action has an equal and opposite reaction? As it happens, when you’re trying to, ah, get the motion of the ocean going, in a chair with wheels that aren’t locked, there’s a sort of counter motion that starts and fucks it all up. So we were going nowhere fast except for inching along the floor in his bedroom. And laughing at the silliness, which isn’t helping. Eventually he just stops and says “Maybe we can get some of those wooden block things they use to keep little planes from rolling away, like in Indiana Jones you know?”

I absolutely lost it. Like laughing so hard I’m in tears, he’s giggling half at the situation and half at my reaction, and everything just keeps setting me off again. FINALLY I get it under control, doing some deep breathing exercises and shit, and I look at him again. And he pulls the straightest face he can, and says, for the love of god, “Golly. This sure is uncomfortable.” Folks if I had asthma I would have fucking died right there. I laughed so hard I think I pulled a rib. Like wheezing and not even laughing anymore so much as weeping and making this awful “heeeeee” noise when I could catch my breath. While he’s laughing and rubbing my back and saying he’s sorry, he couldn’t resist.

So yeah, confirmed, no fetish here, and this magnificent bastard’s comedic timing might actually kill me.

I doubt I’ll update again, because there’s really nothing I can see needing to share given everything sort of worked out. And in the end, the real assholes were the….friends we made along the way? Idk. Thanks for all the lovely comments on my last post and for coming along with me on this absurd but brief drama in my life, lol.

[\[UPDATE\] Am I the Asshole for breaking my sex rule with a handicapped guy: met his family. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1cr8f7p/update_am_i_the_asshole_for_breaking_my_sex_rule/)- May 13, 2024

Hello again! I was going to post this on my own page but a few people mentioned that they think it’s nice to read on AITAH, so fuck it, here’s the “met Mikes family” update. And it's a doozy, or at least felt like it at the time for a girl who grew up with a small, dysfunctional family.

So first up, you know what people (at least me) don’t think about when dating a guy who’s always sitting? Height. I know he’s taller than me because we cuddle a lot, and he’s taller sitting on the couch, but I didn’t reeeeeeally get it. So we drive up Friday night after work (actually south and west, lol, but to my brain it’s always up) in his vehicle, which is modified to be driven entirely using his hands. Neat, right? He’s a really good driver too. One more green flag. We get to the house, and it’s…. It’s huge you guys, LOL like not a mansion, just kind of a sprawling one floor rancher. Real estate was wild back in the day.

Anyway we get out, and I meet his mom. I’d like to point out I am no slouch, I’m 5’-friggin-7. His mom is TOWERING over me. But she was the nicest lady ever. We go inside and I meet his dad (who funny enough is apparently the only short one in this family) and his youngest sister, who is living there with his one year old niece. She gets up to hug me and SHE IS ALSO REALLY TALL. It’s already a bit late then, so we eat and head to bed, I get to see his cute as shit room from when he was a teenager, and I casually ask “hey, so uh, I don’t know how this works and stuff, but how tall are you?” and Mike is all “I dunno, like a bit over 6’4? Been a while since I checked.” A BIT OVER 6’4. “So, is everyone in your family tall?” “…..kinda?”

We met the Nordic Basketball team he calls a family properly the next day. (Actually they’re Irish, but they’re blond and tall so it conveys the idea better.) The ONLY one of reasonable height, and still taller than me, was his oldest sister, lol.

They are also LOUD. Like not really shouting or anything usually, just, PRESENT. Mike is a lot different around them, but in the cutest way, like he just beams all the time and you can see how happy he is to be home. One of his brothers put him in a headlock and gave him a dang NOOGIE as a greeting, and got elbowed in the side for it, and all of them laughing. And his mom smacked one of his brothers with a rolled up magazine for putting his feet on the table. More laughing. Just… intimidating but in the happiest way imaginable. I’ll admit I was a little shut down for a bit, but Mike kept checking in with me to make sure I was okay, and they were all really nice, so I got into the spirit after a bit.

I mentioned this in another comment, but Mike has a special sports wheelchair he uses for, well, sports. And he and his siblings play basketball. And he is GOOD. Apart from just having a hell of an arm, he’s quick as hell. And this magnificent bastard that I love will absolutely, purposefully, GLEEFULLY run someone’s toes over. He AIMS for it. They all have this yank-back-the-foot maneuver that’s hysterical to watch.

So it was this crazy day of loud people playing and having a blast, nieces and nephews running around, and just noise. My ears are still ringing. The food was catered in advance because his mom “had seven babies, all I make on mother’s day is margaritas.” They also have a pool, it’s a bit chilly still but the pool is HEATED so we actually all got to swim, which was a lot of fun because I got to show off that I too am athletic…. I can do a backwards somersault off a diving board! Yeah. I’m a real catch lol. They at least pretended to be impressed.

We all stayed up late drinking and bitching that it was too overcast to see the aurora (boo) and I had the worst hangover I’ve had in a while on Sunday. We slept in a bit late, and then joined Mike’s family for the BBQ part of the BBQ weekend. His dad can GRILL, people. And he’s fast, food coming off the grill at lightning speed. I asked Mike about it and he laughed and said “there was seven of us to feed. Ever see a nest of baby birds? He had practice.” Which, fair enough.

I don’t have much experience with babies, but I got to hold his youngest niece (the one living at home with his sis until her husband gets back from deployment) and we had a light talk about kids in the future. I told him that I never put much thought into it but if they were going to grow up in a happy home like his and not how I grew up, I’m pretty sure I’d be open to having them with him someday. But later. I need him all to myself for a while first. He seemed really really happy about that, which makes ME feel all goofy and happy. I’m sappy.

We had to drive home Sunday night, but before we went his mom hugged me and said she’s NEVER seen her son like this, and thanked me for taking good care of her baby. And asked if we’d be back for the 4th of July or if we were doing something with my family. And I tried to be all “haaaa no we’ll be here if you don’t mind, I don’t see them much” and I think she caught on that there’s more to the story so she just hugged the shit out of me (vikings, all of them I swear) and told me she can’t wait to see me again.

My ears are still ringing from all the noise and chaos, but it was an absolute blast and I can’t wait to see them again in July. Also, pretty much sure Mike is the man I’m going to marry. I literally can’t think of a single reason why I would ever let him get away.

Anyway thanks for reading, hope you all had a lovely weekend, and those of you who got to see the aurora I’m happy for you but you suck, lol.

[UPDATE (again) Dating a disabled guy: 4th of July](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1dwwpu3/update_again_dating_a_disabled_guy_4th_of_july/?share_id=28uznRUDOte2UicUTh1s6&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1) - July 6, 2024

UPDATE (again) Dating a disabled guy: 4th of July - July 6, 2024 As I’ve gotten a ton of requests for updates, I figured I would let you guys know how things are going in my world. You know how sometimes a relationship looks amazing at first but then all the red flags start showing up?

This isn’t one of those stories, lol.

Sorry, that was mean, but I couldn’t resist. Okay, on to the actual update! No we aren’t engaged yet. Yes we have talked about it in the context of how seriously we are taking things. No babies yet either obviously, we are diligent about birth control. I want Mike all to myself for a while.

So, the 4th of July visit to his family’s house was pretty awesome. After getting to know everyone last time I had better expectations of what I was going into, and I’ve talked with my therapist about the whole “play fighting makes me anxious because in my childhood home it wasn’t playing” thing. I don’t want them to ever curb how they act to cater to me, and instead I guess I’ll consider it immersion therapy. I think Mike mentioned it anyway because I didn’t see much of it this time, though there were cheerful threats of doom lobbed about which I didn’t mind at all.

His mom is amazing, I’d like to point out. Even if she moms so hard it makes me weepy. So, background info: I have a really common sounding name spelled REALLY uncommonly. Think Danyell or Jessikah. Because in addition to everything else my parents decided to be creative when they named me. So, although I do sort of like my name, that meant I was that kid who never saw their name personalized on anything. Mike’s family, on the other hand, had like a million kids and they all got traditional names, so personalized stuff was huge for them (it kept them from fighting over stuff I guess.) One of the things in their house, because they have a pool, is that each of the kids (adults now) has their own personalized beach towel that lives at the house.

So we get to their place and it’s been a hot drive there, so right after we get in Mike suggests I go to his room to get changed into a swimsuit so we can have a dip in the pool. I’m thinking that sounds perfect, right? Some of you may already know where this is going…. I get to his room and there is a towel on the bed. In my favorite color. With my fucking stupid-ass-spelled name embroidered into it. So here I am crying over a goddamn towel and he’s in the doorway watching and grinning like he just pranked me or some shit. Turns out it was HER idea but she checked with Mike to make sure it was spelled right. So now I have a towel for when we visit because APPARENTLY I’m welcome.

If I sound cranky it’s just because I’m better at self-depreciation than I am expressing emotions in a direct way. I really am blown away and touched by how much these people have welcomed me. Mike has already sort of learned to decode the way I talk and joke, which is nice, but the first time he gently said “that’s not humor, that’s just putting yourself down, babe,” I definitely wanted to go hide under the table. He doesn’t let me be mean to me. That’s a thing good partners do, I guess? I wouldn’t know. (Again, yes I am in therapy, I am working on myself, it’s not his responsibility to put me back together, it’s just something he does naturally.) I literally told him one night that I was sorry I’m kind of broken, and he snorted and said “at least you can walk” in the most disgusted voice ever and made me laugh.

I digress. So the food was once again amazing, and I kept my promise to teach his mom how to make my cinnamon bun bread pudding, so I felt like I contributed. (Insert Ralph Wiggum “I’m Helping!” meme.) I learned to play Yahtzee, and as it turns out I am very good at it. They do a lot of board games things at night when everyone is staying for the week. These people have a LOT of board games. And puzzles. Whole damn storage closet of the things. They also drink like fuckin FISH and can hold it so I am learning to pace myself. Mike doesn’t drink much when we aren’t there so I’m not worried that it’s a red flag. Only red flag of his that I’ve found was a Red Sox pennant in his room.

Now I realize I might be talking him up a lot, but he isn’t perfect! He snores, he has a habit of arguing with people on the TV when they make stupid decisions, he sometimes starts talking about things I don’t understand and just goes and goes until he realizes he lost me like 15 minutes ago, and he is FASTIDIOUSLY tidy, which makes me feel guilty because I have bad habits to lose. I’m not used to “clutter means I can’t move through an area” but I’m really trying. I barely spend any time at my own place anymore, and we’re definitely looking to move in together sooner than later.

Yeah, so, not that much of an update, no one burned themselves on a firework or anything super exciting, I’m just in an ongoing relationship with a great guy who has a great family and things continue to look up for us. We head home tonight so we can spend some alone time Sunday. Hope everyone else had a safe and happy holiday!

Edit: My extremely unhealthy but delicious cinnamon bun bread pudding recipe:

So you take two pop tubes of Pillsbury cinnamon buns and bake them per the instructions, but reserve the icing. Then turn off the oven and leave them in there for another 10 minutes (you want them a little overbaked.) Cool, then chop them up into pretty big rough pieces. Use a 13 x 9 pan with high sides, and put like 1/2 stick of melted butter in there and coat the bottom and sides.

Preheat oven to 400. Whisk up 8 eggs with 1/4 cup of half and half or heavy cream, put the cinnamon bun chunks in the pan, and then pour over the egg and cream mixture. Get in there with your hands to spread it out and make sure the egg and cream is mostly or totally absorbed. You can add another egg if it looks too dry, eggs aren't always the same size lol.

Bake for 20ish minutes uncovered until it feels firm, then add the icing from the tubes all over the top and let it cool a bit till the icing is super runny.

It can be served hot as is or brought somewhere and reheated in an oven for a bit, but if you reheat it cover it so the icing doesn't dry out.

I debated just posting this on my own page, but shit , like a lot of people keep asking for more so I guess it doesn’t hurt to drop my post between “AITAH for literally killing someone” and “AITAH for meekly accepting my inlaw’s cruelty but asking if I may wash my wounds before they flog me again.”

This is not an exciting update. Not engaged. No babies on the way, not even freakishly tall ones like some of you are hexing me with. But…. Jess finally met Mike.

TLDR: Learning to read long posts is good for your attention span.

SORRY! I mean I’m not sorry, I feel compelled to open with a joke and I don’t know why. Anyway real TLDR she thinks he’s amazing, she thinks it is HYSTERICAL that I’m on tictok (I refuse to download it) and she is doing amazing. And our lives are moving forward together.

Jess and I have this friend, who I will call Meg and NOT TALULAH despite both Jess and Mike thinking would be hilarious. Meg was planning to have a birthday party, the big THREE OH, and she and Jess are close (and both presently single.) They chose a local bar with outside seating, and Jess did a “wait, lets check their accessibility” because I have been bitching to her for the last month. And lol and be-fucking-hold after calling the place, they didn’t have a ramp for the balcony/outside seating area.

As I have been told Jess said “nope I am meeting Mr. Throwra\_JessComeOn” and so they found another place that’s a damn hike from everyone. But it has a great outside area with accessibility. And THEN we got the invite. Through Facebook because we are all basic, I guess? And Mike was stoked because they have this awesome beer selection (full stop I hate hops sooooo). Then Meg told us that (no I am not using Talulah for the 15% of you going “oh but that was such a better name”) they chose it because Jess wanted Mike to feel welcome. So hats off to Jess for making the comeback impression of the century, I guess.

The birthday was fun, and silly, and everyone in my immediate friend group met Mike and loved him. Tons of laughter, everyone drank way too much, but fortunately we had enough heads up for a planned motel stay (why yes, I do own a UV flashlight, why do you ask?) so we and a bunch of other people didn’t drive home. We actually had brunch in the bar the next day, it was absolutely awesome and I am ruined for pancakes because FLUFFY.

Once again, I digress.

Jess and Mike hit it off and she told him literally *every* story I didn’t want her to over brunch, and it all was great apart from the persistent hangover. I crashed at Mike’s again. Annnnnnd then he asked what it would cost to break my lease, because he hates the mornings he wakes up and I’m not there. So the next upcoming week and a half or so is going to be insane while I pack up my whole damn life and shove half into a storage unit and the other half into his apartment, and then we’ll be living together.

I know it’s too soon. He does too. We’ve decided we’re idiots and just going for it. My landlord is a lady who is a bit on the older side and isn’t charging me for breaking the lease as long as I leave the place ready for a new renter, so I may respond to comments for a bit right away but expect a lot of silence for a while after.

True TLDR: Best friend made a good second impression, and I’m moving in with Mike ahead of schedule. I should be worried but I’m actually just really excited. Wish me luck!!",333,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1eolo01/new_update_aitah_for_breaking_my_number_1_sex/,LTN,

post,16 year old gang-raped by police forced to have an abortion -- an ER doctor confirmed and is receiving death threats [translation in post],2019-11-09 14:38:25," Translation of the [news article from Liberty Times](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/2972517) on 11/09: 

""Ever since the anti-extradition law amendment bill movement started, many civilians have been arrested by the Hong Kong police. Among them, many women claimed that they were sexually harassed or even assaulted by HK police. Yesterday, a piece of information came out that a 16-year-old teenager was gang-raped by the police while she was in police custody, got pregnant, and was forced to have an abortion and forced to remain silent. About this, an ER doctor working at the hospital confirmed on his Facebook page. He also claimed that complaints have been filed against him, and that he is receiving death threats.

A HK internet user [disclosed this scandal](https://lihkg.com/thread/1700885/page/1) on[ lihkg.com](http://lihkg.com/) yesterday (the 8th), stating that a young woman was arrested during one of the protests, and that while she was in police custody, she was raped by multiple police officers, and unfortunately got pregnant. This post also stated that she had an abortion surgery yesterday at the Elizabeth Hospital. According to this internet user, this incident has spread widely among the medical professionals; he/she also swore on his/her entire families’ lives that everything in the post was true.

Today, an ER doctor made a post on his Facebook page “[Dr. Ray’s Emergency Room Journey.](https://www.facebook.com/dr.ray.on.call/posts/1404352349705828)” He stated that he already knew about it last week, and now this news “is like a fire that can no longer be concealed by paper”. He said that he is not the person who made the post on[ lihkg.com](http://lihkg.com/), but he already had complaints filed and death threats made against him. “But I believe that even if I fall down, there will be thousands of my colleagues who will continue to blow this whistle, just like now”

In the end, he also pleaded people in Hong Kong to not surround the hospital, because the medical professionals are put in a tight spot, that they are not able to “open their mouths”. He called for people in Hong Kong to convert their anger into support for the victims. “Hospital is a place for reasons and is not a battleground; I hope everyone can share their opinions peacefully”

In this post, he also shared [another scandal-disclosing post](https://www.facebook.com/hasecretspage/posts/2458946840894022?__tn__=K-R). Besides stating what happened to this 16 year old teenage girl, this other post also stated that there are attorneys looking into this incident, DNA sample collected, and that an investigation is underway.”

post,Should I make a tutorial for advanced LTN?,2023-05-27 17:27:21,"After dozens of hours working with LTN I returned to common trains, but almost immediately I understood that I won't ever play factorio without this mode. The reason why I tried to work without LTN were many of times when damn trains returned to depots with cargo left and then ruined the whole production.

It took me a long time, but I've made a station that works properly and requests as many trains as needed (valid mainly for big distances) and doesn't make them leave the station with something in cargo. Same with providers and guys, if you want me to make a tutorial, please let me know. The best in it is that this blueprint works for trains with multiple wagons and can be expanded to as many wagons as you need.

I've already made an easier tutorial in Steam, check if you want, but this one can definitely be improved. Link:[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2977302133](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2977302133)

I'm trying the very basic that is :  
 \- Depot : A  
 \- Provider : B

Anyone knows why this is happening ?

comment,,2025-10-16 15:52:22,"The current method I've seen the interior crowd use is to name all provider stations the same thing, and make certain every provider station has a backlog of trains waiting to be filled

LTN allowed you to give providers unique names so it's clear what they're producing, and you can get by with far fewer trains. I haven't used LTN since 2.0, but a reduction of 75% was not uncommon, and some claimed a reduction of 90% (so 10 trains under LTN could run a base that required 100 trains before). My personal experience was that the 75% reduction is more accurate, but whatever

LTN also makes mixed deliveries much easier to handle, which is especially useful with mods that add larger wagons (I've got one now with 120 slot wagons, and waiting for the station to produce that many blue chips is *fun*)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1o80tbx/ltn_mod_so_freaking_hard/njsnueh/,,LTN Mod... so freaking hard.

post,My wife handwrote all of 'No Country for Old Men' as a gift to me... I don't deserve her.,2025-09-28 14:47:45,"My wife and I were traveling on my birthday. We arrived at our hotel and she said she was excited to give me my birthday gift. She said she brought two gifts for me. She gave me a black felt bag and told me to open it first. I opened the bag and didn't understand exactly what it was that she gave me. It was several used and empty pens. I thanked her for them but she interrupted and said, ""It'll make more sense when you open the next gift."" I opened it and it was an A4 size, black, leather book with the words, 'No Country for Old Men' lasered into the leather. I thought maybe she bought me a sketch journal and the used pens were supposed to be art supplies - which would have been a great gift. ""Open it,"" she said. I opened it and the pages were filled. I thought maybe she wrote me several notes, or that maybe she passed the book around to friends to have them write a birthday note. It wasn't until I began flipping the pages and recognized the sentences that I realized the obvious. She handwrote the entire book for me... Disbelief doesn't paint it. She had worked on this for months. I still can't believe it. What an absolutely wonderful friend. It's the most thoughtful and meaningful gifts I've ever received. I wanted to share it with you all.

comment,,2025-11-25 14:49:12,"I fly into LTN regularly. For the RINIS1N assuming RWY 25 in use, London initially tell you to descend when ready FL220 to be level @ RINIS so this will be somewhere before/over the channel or over Belgium perhaps. You can also hard tune FL220 in the MCDU so the TOD arrow is accurate. After that you calculate descent with the 1 in 3 rule so you need 3nm per 1000ft to lose. So RINIS-IDESI is 16nm to loose 4000ft (FL180 @ IDESI). So you’d need 12nm to loose 4000ft which is doable and could be done in “DES” mode for the Airbus.

Then normally you never go any further than COCCU and can expect radar vectors for the right base leg on 25 (For 07 radar vectors for a downwind left base. Around COCCU ATC normally expect you to be around 8000ft. LTN is also good because they manage speed for you so it’s highly unlikely you’d ever be in a high situation. Also the second ATC give you vectors your off the STAR so alt constraints don’t matter anymore. If ATC tell you “free speed” that generally means expect a fat shortcut and get down. Again ATC would help with extra track miles if unable.

The typical response is ""show me the bodies"". In the last 30 years, vehicles on our roads have doubled and now there's a bunch of you demanding that every road should be a convenient rat run, endangering residents despite having a main road network. 

The beauty is that these closures make roads healthier and happier places to live while giving people more travel choices.

post,Struggling to scale our vanilla LTN-style train network (wagon length + tile space issue),2025-10-24 17:16:43,"Hey everyone,

https://preview.redd.it/hfyzyrf0t2xf1.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d18de9a235e932bb381c897c56befc1334aa7959

me and my friend have been building a rail-based city in Factorio, and our entire logistics system runs on a vanilla version of LTN using the “new” interrupt system. Basically, trains automatically detect which resource is needed in the network, and the first available train goes to a Provider station, then unloads at a Requester station. It’s been working super smoothly so far… but now we’ve hit a couple of big issues.



Problem #1: Handling different train lengthsIf a station needs a train with 2+ wagons, we can’t find a way to communicate that to the depot system. Is there any way to send a signal through the network that says, “I need a train with two (or more) wagons”? We want to keep things scalable, so manually assigning trains or setting up fixed routes isn’t really an option.

Our current workaround. We made all trains 4 wagons long. Then we set up a system that communicates esource demand per wagon. e.g.1 wagon = 4k iron plates; 2 wagons = 8k etc. That way, every station can technically host a 4-wagon train, but depending on how the station is configured, it will only load/unload 1–4 wagons. For example: A plastic provider/requester usually handles just 1 wagon (since demand never gets too high). Iron plate stations often handle 3–4 wagons This works fine logically, but…

https://preview.redd.it/evr9aci4t2xf1.png?width=833&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=143d07609192efa236bf39cdd7b74f6caf275cd3



Problem #2 — Space and tile layout: Now every station needs to fit a 4-wagon train. We’re using 100x100 tiles, and we just can’t find a way to fit all the stations (including train stackers) within that area.Even worse, for tiles where multiple resources are both produced and requested (4–5 resources per tile), there’s simply no way to fit everything — loaders, unloaders, stackers, and all — without spilling onto the main rail lines.

[OLD System](https://preview.redd.it/ntx87occt2xf1.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9f17252429722e916a9ed502d614a1e45c6687d)

Our question is: How can we design a layout that fits loading/unloading rails and a small stacker area within a 100x100 tile, without blocking the main network? Any advice, screenshots, or blueprint examples would be massively appreciated! We really want to keep the setup compact and scalable without having to break our vanilla “LTN-like” logic.",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1of0hvn/struggling_to_scale_our_vanilla_ltnstyle_train/,LTN,
comment,,2025-10-24 17:28:15,"&gt; If a station needs a train with 2+ wagons

A train stop does not need a train with 2+ wagons. It needs a train with *exactly* two wagons. You don't want half-full trains running around; either it's completely full or completely empty.

And you definitely don't want loading stations that empty part of their buffers quickly. That can lead to problems where a loading station *thinks* that it has the resources to load a train (ie: it has 16k plates), but the first buffer is actually empty (because the later buffers have 8k plates each), so the train sits there for a while.

A train stop should deal in one resource and one train size. In my setup (which does not use this LTN-esque complexity and instead just has more trains), each train stop is named according to the type of train it takes. These are virtual signals; a 1-4 cargo train uses the signal `4`, a 1-4 fluid train uses the signal `D`(ouble the 1-2 length), etc. And my blueprints for train stops are parameterized on these, so you select which one you want and it's automatically encoded into the stop name.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1of0hvn/struggling_to_scale_our_vanilla_ltnstyle_train/nl5h3x1/,,Struggling to scale our vanilla LTN-style train network (wagon length + tile space issue)
comment,,2025-10-24 17:35:28,Hey. I have thought about that same problem ( taking herę about problem #1 ). And the jest that I could think of is to include quality signals into the mix. I have already given up on the vanilla ltn network but the idea was to send different quality signals for different length trains but I guess that would require separate depots for all train lengths. Hope this might inspire you to find the right solutions :),,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1of0hvn/struggling_to_scale_our_vanilla_ltnstyle_train/nl5ilff/,,Struggling to scale our vanilla LTN-style train network (wagon length + tile space issue)
comment,,2025-10-24 17:41:55,"Personally, I would either just not use variable length trains.

But if you do want to use variable length trains, I would pick 2 sizes.  Small trains for most things, large trains for the things that need large trains (mostly ore and plates, I would think - though if you're in Space Age, fluid wagons are much better than plates for moving metal) and just build separate schedules and station names for those trains, so you'd end up with 3 train schedules (short, long, fluid) instead of 2.

Alternately, go parallel instead of scale.  The picture shows loads of space for the shorter trains, so stick in a rail signal and increase the train limit by 1 and now instead of having just 1x 1:2 trains, you have 2x 1:2 trains and you don't have to worry about how to mix in 2:4 trains.

Another way to do it is to just make all the trains long and don't use the ""is full"" interrupt, but instead use the ""circuit signal"" interrupt.  Then build your provide stations so they read the contents of the train and then send the ""Go"" signal telling them they're full.  That way if a station only needs 1 cargo wagon (like blue chips) then you can fill just one and leave the other 3 empty, but if a station needs all 4 wagons (like coal) you can fill all 4.  The corresponding unload stations would, of course, only unload the wagons you loaded.

You'll waste acceleration and fuel hauling around empty wagons but you will standardize your trains and it's not like a busy train network can move faster than the slowest train anyway.

&gt;How can we design a layout that fits loading/unloading rails and a small stacker area within a 100x100 tile,

Coil the rail around the perimeter and use linear stackers (i.e. a queue).  Or use a neighboring block and designate that particular production unit to be a 2 block unit.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1of0hvn/struggling_to_scale_our_vanilla_ltnstyle_train/nl5jxkp/,,Struggling to scale our vanilla LTN-style train network (wagon length + tile space issue)
comment,,2025-10-24 18:55:05,"&gt;But if you do want to use variable length trains, I would pick 2 sizes. Small trains for most things, large trains for the things that need large trains (mostly ore and plates, I would think - though if you're in Space Age, fluid wagons are much better than plates for moving metal) and just build separate schedules and station names for those trains, so you'd end up with 3 train schedules (short, long, fluid) instead of 2.

Totally doable. We actually thought about having three train schedules, but probably forgot because we got mixed up with other issues (like load/unload sizes), so we ended up not doing it.  
We’ll definitely give it a try now that you reminded us. Thanks for that!

&gt;Another way to do it is to just make all the trains long and don't use the ""is full"" interrupt, but instead use the ""circuit signal"" interrupt. Then build your provide stations so they read the contents of the train and then send the ""Go"" signal telling them they're full. That way if a station only needs 1 cargo wagon (like blue chips) then you can fill just one and leave the other 3 empty, but if a station needs all 4 wagons (like coal) you can fill all 4. The corresponding unload stations would, of course, only unload the wagons you loaded.

Yeah, we already have it set up like that. Our “Go” signal is actually “D(one)”. Circuit-wise, everything’s working fine. It’s just that we don’t have enough space for the 4-wagon trains, rotfl.

&gt;Coil the rail around the perimeter and use linear stackers (i.e. a queue). Or use a neighboring block and designate that particular production unit to be a 2 block unit.

mmm.. might give it a try. They wouldn't stop in a train stacker for long anyway...",,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1of0hvn/struggling_to_scale_our_vanilla_ltnstyle_train/nl5z2m7/,,Struggling to scale our vanilla LTN-style train network (wagon length + tile space issue)
comment,,2025-10-24 17:46:42,"&gt;If a station needs a train with 2+ wagons

I use different train lenghts on the same deposit, here is how I managed to filter resource request by train lenght. (look at the following coment for the unloading station)

I did a ""train ruler"" with rail signals conected with wires. Each segment is fo the lenght of one wagon,they are conected to a decider combinator that compares the amount wo wagons to the request signals. If you want your coal trains to be four wagons but your uranium only two I set the coal=4 and uranium=2 as the request signals, when those signals go to my depot they will only reach the train of the required lenght.

comment,,2019-04-03 17:33:41,"THE GRID. 0.16, Bobs + Angels + SpaceX + LTN

Hello ! This fall with my buddy and fellow redditor /u/zazard we decided to
play a little bit of Factorio. After launching a rocket in vanilla during a
week-end we went megabase, then went bot bus, then lost to UPS.

So we started a new game, this time with trains in mind, and the glorious idea
to do a GRID. Where each cell would have one job, and trains would do
everything.

We started with Bobs, Angels and LTN.

Incrementaly for convenience we added Waterfill (not barreling water to those
120 nukelar centrals thanks), long reach, squick through and maybe a couple of
others.

I had drafted very quickly a blueprint for a train ""Cell"", with no intention of
keeping it for too long. Buuut we kept it until the end, despite the apparent
inefficiency and bottleneck-ecy of the roundabouts. But they rarely were our
biggest issue so... We kept them.

There are a hundred small wrong things with this Factory but after a month on it
we burnt out a tiny bit. We'll probably re-do it better when 1.0 hits.

So... Here's a botched imgur album of some parts of the map : https://imgur.com/a/amh4os1

Also thanks to the wonders of technology here is a Google Maps link to visit the
whole fucking factory : https://poneybl.eu/~zaz/thegrid/

Feel free to ask questions, we'll try to answer them as well as we can :-)

I'll be home in a few hours and can throw more screenshots / blueprints if needed.

Edit: 

Things learned during this session :

1. Bob's modules are awesome. Once you unlock them you don't have to do rows and rows of factories to have a decent production, which feels really nice. Since you had to do it once already

2. Bio-chemistry in Angels is one of the most interesting puzzles we've had to solve in this game. Making plastic out of cucumbers took 3 tries and felt awesome once it worked.

3. Petrochem in Angels... Oh God the headache. 

4. Watch your steps. We were killed by trains a LOT building this. Especially /u/zazard :D

5. Blueprint for a single rail + signal cell, should work in Vanilla :  https://factorioprints.com/view/-Lb_ryEP-wFAQoF2XIu1

6. Gif of a research being launched by this thing : https://imgur.com/a/hTtaCwo

It's usually a good idea to also run powerlines along your rails in these blueprints so wherever they go you'll have power.

comment,,2024-10-10 18:26:05,"I'd recommend double one way rail system, so you'll always have two pairs of traffic, just like normal roads.

Then have something to get the trains off the main track and another to get them back on. The in and off the main tracks should have a curved rail connecting to both sides of the track, that way a train can get there from either direction.

From there you can build a structured rail network fairly easily, but also be flexible enough to be able to place an outpost pretty much anywhere. You could make a city blocks out of it, but at least when I'm making stuff I just end up with a few rectangular sections of rails, and then several offshoots, so everything isn't the same shape, but everything still fits together.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1g0g27f/train_spaghetti_is_funny_but_should_i_try/lr9u1ff/,,Train Spaghetti is funny... but should I try building a city block base instead? download LTN?

comment,,2024-06-08 23:33:33,"I recently learned LTN. It's a powerful tool. It has a built-in S/R latch for train stops, which means if set up correctly you will be able to achieve your logistic goal with fewer trains than vanilla. The depot function is fantastic. You can create a singular mega depot for your trains, and LTN will call upon them once the requirement for transportation is met.  You can easily manage multi-item cargo wagons, like for example outpost deliveries of ammo, oil, repair packs and bots. You can forget about complex fuel deliveries, as it's only necessary to deliver fuel to your depot. It takes a bit to learn to use it properly (I am a bit weak with circuitry, but slowly learning more advanced stuff) but you shouldn't be discouraged. In my humble opinion, LTN is a must-have for a train aficionado.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/Factoriohno/comments/1dbbf6c/do_i_need_ltn_to_manage_my_complicated_trainbase/l7qbawu/,,Do I need LTN to manage my complicated trainbase factory (see pic)?

&gt;Disagree = Nazi, Modern liberalism at Its peak  Hiding behind downvotes, No counter arguement. Typical liberal behavior.
&gt;&gt;""Disagree = Nazi"" More like post history = nazi, stop being retarded
&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree. Stop being r*tarded. Just because someone disagrees with you doesnt mean he is a nazi.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It really astounds me how the fucking dumbest people are the ones bringing slurs against intellectually disabled people back  There’s got to be a word for it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Truth hurts.

[Typical of a World war loser to use the word ""degenerate"". cope and seethe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporncirclejerk/comments/1mmvjli/5_years_ago_i_moved_from_germany_to_texas_here_is/n80lft0/)
&gt;Cascadia has a world-wide reputation for degeneracy though. Portland. CHAZ. Masked thugs. It's like the capital of antifa weirdness in the Western hemisphere.
&gt;&gt;Wtf does that even mean?!?! ""Masked thugs""??? Do you just watch Fox News and nothing else all day long? CHAZ has been over and done with for years. And since when is it ""weird"" to be anti-fascist?
&gt;&gt;&gt;CHAZ is an illustration of the weirdness. It is not weird to dislike fascists, but it is weird to be antifa. It's a specific odd subculture, widely unpopular, about on par with Proud Boys. Above KKK and AB but below NRA and BLM, which are super controversial too. And Cascadia seems to be full of them.  I can't say I entirely hate antifa as e.g. Russian antifa proved to be OK and against the invasion of Ukraine so I wouldn't call them rotten. But they're definitely super weird, some of the oddest people out there and fairly degenerate (which is not the worst thing to happen to a person).  [image](https://preview.redd.it/cxplxnaffaif1.png?width=621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=021c668a4b4f7191bf18cc05f8eca46101a82da9)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why is ""weird"" degenerate??? I still don't understand what you mean by that term. Just cause something is odd to you doesn't mean its degenerate. And that chart doesn't mean much when Planned Parenthood, of all things, is only three spots below Antifa lol
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Something can be odd and not degenerate. Degenerate means that it is an element that is self-destructive, self-hating, associated with perversions and uncleanliness, like a manifestation of a dying and collapsing society.  As you can see on the graph, planned parenthood is fairly widely supported, but antifa or Proud Boys are not.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you think the people of Cascadia are ""self-destructive, self-hating, perverse, and unclean"" then you've either never been to this region of the world, or you've drunk the conservative cool-aid. Jeez.

[You know bro likely hasn’t travelled if he hasn’t yet realized Texas is literally hell on earth ](https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporncirclejerk/comments/1mmvjli/5_years_ago_i_moved_from_germany_to_texas_here_is/n810tng/)
&gt;Like heat? Or what
&gt;&gt;It’s one of the worst states to live imo. Horrible weather, constant storms, constant power outages, terrible city layouts, no zoning, terrible roads, terrible schools, fucking bugs everywhere, lots of cartel / gang activity, tons of homeless there isn’t much to like 
&gt;&gt;&gt;In all the categories you mentioned, Texas is actually pretty average. For example, comparing car-centric Dallas to car-centric LA, there isn't really a clear winner. What gives Texas is a leg up is its relatively low cost of living in relation to the economic opportunity.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LA and Dallas have to be two of the worst most car centric cities in the country 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nothing wrong with car centric cities if done right DFW has the best highway system in the US I’ve spent extended time in Chicago, Miami, New York, and Philadelphia I at least prefer the DFW system but I guess it could be just because I grew up there.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a fundamental issue that car-centric cities emit far higher emissions, cause far greater noise, visual pollution, and will always have far higher road fatalities than walkable cities. Meanwhile, those unable to drive or afford a car will be essentially disabled. High population growth means everybody is forced to buy cars, highways have to be expanded constantly, but car use increases as a result due to the expansion of suburbs further away from the city centre. So there'll always be more traffic jams, fatalities, and road rage no matter how many more lanes you build. If you've been outside of the US, you'll realize how good other countries have it.

&gt;Give examples for all of those things you just mentioned and I'll believe you. 
&gt;&gt;well i can vouch for the storms and the terrible weather, but i think the power outages are from the winter storms being so overblown
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah, Texas power lines aren't built for ice and snow. Bro is also weak for complaining about the weather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lmao ‘weak’ is massive cope. Good weather is good weather being weak doesn’t change that 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guarantee that Texas has a richer history than whatever hole you crawled out of to bitch online about how Texas is the worst place ever. Have you ever even lived here bro? Sure there are pockets of shit all over exams, but if you actually look instead of stereotype, then you'll see how great the lone star state is. Also, we were a country, you weren't. L

&gt;Highest HDI in the world!
&gt;&gt;Yeah but Boston is there, so that puts Mass somewhere between Somalia and one of the Congos  Edit: enjoy the lively conversation this comment has spurned regarding the violence and racism in Boston 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Bro Boston is one of the most safest major cities in America. Ask anyone who lives in Boston and you’ll find that there’s rarely any violent crimes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ask anyone non white who lives there and they’ll tell you it’s the most racist city in the northeast
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As an Indian girl living in Boston I very much disagree. The attitude towards everyone, regardless of race and appearance is quite live and let live. My father moved around the northeast a certain amount around 9 / 11, and though he is Indian, he often gets mistaken for middle eastern. He says Boston is the only place he wasn't constantly getting judgemental looks (and in the 2001 - 2005 period, he lived in NYC, Boston, Philly and Providence).

[You can see how effective the propaganda is in Texas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporncirclejerk/comments/1mmvjli/5_years_ago_i_moved_from_germany_to_texas_here_is/n81u275/)
&gt;Seriously, if homelessness is the SECOND thing you think of when you think of California, the propaganda is pretty entrenched. Not to mention the other West Coast states being tagged for their ""degeneracy"". I would argue that pretty much any large enough metropolitan area in the US has the type of degeneracy that OP is mentioning, its not something unique to the Pacific Northwest.  Also Illinois is crime, because of Chicago? Does OP live somewhere between 1920 and 1970? Illinois is a lot more than Chicago, and Chicago is not exactly the Mecca of crime in the US. Is it safe? Most parts, yes actually.
&gt;&gt;California has the highest homeless population, BY FAR. The only reason it's not the 2nd thing I think about is because it's the first.  One of the premier cities in California literally has an app to help people avoid human poop on the sidewalks
&gt;&gt;&gt;The state with the most people also has the most homeless people!? How did this happen!?  The highest per capita homeless population is Hawaii, by far.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Per capita is meaningless in this discussion lol
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why would it be?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Because we're talking about what a state is known for. If a state has the most of something, they're likely to be known for it. Her dumb argument is like saying ""why is Colorado known for mountains when Vermont actually has more mountains per square mile?!""
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just curious, when you think of California do you think of Republicans too? Because California has more Republicans than any other state. However, per capita is an entirely different story and that’s how most people think about the prominence of groups of people. *(11 more comments of these two arguing)*

----

The airspace is only available for Korean planes, and there's only one air company named Air Koryo. We were flying on an old Tu-154, and the ventilation didn't work on ground, so the cabin was basically a sauna. The patriotic songs were played loudly during the flight. Flights are made by air company Nordwind, and the first ever plane from Russia to North Korea landed there two days ago. There are only montly flights, so they're likely not really aimed for tourists, but for workers.
 
Surprisingly, the airport had a business class lounge. Although inside the only ""business class"" stuff is a fridge with water bottles and a muffin bowl. You can't go there unless you have the ""VIP-ticket"", whatever this is, and there were no visitors at all.
 
Only Russia and China citizens can enter the country. Tourists can only travel in organized groups, and only Russian tourists are allowed. Some people from the both countries come here for work. I saw a couple of them, and they were heading to cities far from the capital. The visa is single-entry only for the duration of stay. Only 1200 people visit North Korea each year.
 
You have to fill a customs declaration on entry. Tech stuff over $10k is prohibited. One guy tried to pass with a super expensive camera lens, and he was forced to leave it in the airport for storage with the pretext of exceeding the cost. Customs officers didn't ask to unlock the phones and tablets, they didn't connect them to their PCs, although they did ask to show the phones without cases to see the logo on the backside (they were comparing it to the declaration). They were concerned when they saw our USB flash drive on the X-ray. There were a lot of USB adapters connected to the drive, but after due explaining they let us pass. Mobile phones don't connect to any of the local networks, the whole time in the country we had no connection at all. When you move out you don't have to fill any declarations or show any of your stuff.
 
The travel agency said that 85% of our group would be old people nostalgic about USSR, 10% would be bloggers, trying to film something interesting, and 5% would be young people that are impressed by North Korean hackers, trying to see how do they live here. We were surprised to see that most of the people in our group were experienced travelers who have some knowledge about this country and its regime, wanting to compare it to other countries and get their own impression of it.
 
Our group was followed by 5 people: a guide who could speak Russian, two guides who couldn't, and two assistants. Wandering off is prohibited: senior guide goes in front of the group, another two guides go closely behind, and assistants go from the sides. If you try to step a couple meters aside from the route, the assistants say ""you can't go there, come back here"". Sometimes when we tried to film something they said ""you can't film it"". The restaurants, the museums, the memorials – everything is closed for special service and isolated from the locals. After our group was brought to hotel, the porter locked the door with his key. The next evening some people went outside to have a cigarette, but the guides went outside with them: one was smoking too, other were keeping people from wandering away from the hotel.
 
The hotel lobby was pretty neat. Interior looks like it's from 1960s. Lifts look like old japanese ones. All the rooms are for smokers, and they're soaked with the smoke smell. The only requirement is to not smoke in the bed. The toilet in the bathroom is american, as well as the power sockets (although they may be japanese, idk). On the top floor there was a restaurant. The windows there are panoramic, but 1/3 of them are closed, we couldn't look there. Wikimapia shows that there's a bunker somewhere in that direction.
 
The breakfast is like in a three-star hotel: a bun, a cabbage salad, kimchi, smoked fish, fried eggs and coffee. The dishes were cold. The milk for coffee was powdered and not regular liquid one.
 
According to rumors, our rooms were listened 24/7. There was a whole floor for employees. One brave fella asked the guide: ""Is it true that you have a floor for wiretapping officers there?"". He answered with pokerface: ""There's no such floor"". Another tourist then jokingly said: ""But we went there by stairs"", and the guide answered: ""It's impossible, you can't just get there"".
 
There was no TV or radio. Anywhere. Not in hotel, not somewhere else. We couldn't see the media the locals see. The only information source were the newspapers from the stands, and they've only been placed on the metro stations, not on the street. The newspaper in english with partially colored print were given to us on the plane, but they took it back later. The local newspaper is in black and white, and the paper quality is low. The newspaper for foreigners said something like ""We grew even more war power"", the local one – something like ""The respected leader opened the new greenhouse"" or ""Our farmers have harvested even more rice"".
 
Taking pictures from height is prohibited, because you can see the city layout. Taking pictures of the metro scheme is prohibited as well. Taking pictures of construction sites in the city is prohibited too. My guess is that's because 90% of them are frozen: the cranes don't move, there are no people, and by comparing the pictures from different years you could see that the construction sites are basically abandoned. You get the apartment for your merits for the party (the main requirement is working in one place for 40 years). You can't choose where your apartment will be. There are no single houses, only apartments. The class of your apartment depends on how much you did for the party.
 
We saw a lot of ceremonies: in the city people walk in columns in the morning to see the flag raising, in the fields they go in columns to work. Everyone have the party badges. On the badges – two of the dead leaders: Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong Il. The badges are sacred: we tried to get some for the collecting purposes, but the guides wouldn't gift or sell them. We only saw one hobo-looking guy without the badge. All the achievements are connected to the leaders, i.e.: ""Our leader once walked here and told us to plant flowers here"". When the leaders are mentioned, people always use servile words like ""honourable comrade"", with their eyes subserviently shining and their voice being truly ecstatic. Very often we could hear about N. Korean achievements in a context of ""excellence over capitalistic states"".
 
If we take a picture of something with the leaders, like a monument, the rules are very strict: no cropping (the leaders must be standing in their full height), no selfies. If you want to have a shot of yourself by the leader, you must be standing at attention. Smiling during photo is prohibited. The monuments and images are sacred. Note that almost all of the traditional Korean churches are destroyed.
 
Since 5 AM on the outside the music is being played from the speakers. It's loud, and it wakes people up: it's time to go to work! The tourists are settled on the hotel's top floors (30+), but the music is clearly heard from there.
 
The school education lasts for 12 years and is free. Then a citizen can go to army, university, or to factory or farm. The salary is assigned by government. The most highly-paid jobs are doctors, teachers, and engineers. Pension is being paid after a citizen reaches 55/60 years (women/men; physical labor) or 58/63 years (women/men; non-physical labor, like in office).
 
Marriage requires parents' agreement. If a guy or a girl can't find themselves a partner, the parents find it. The groom's family gifts a ring, the bride's – a watch. Divorce is possible, but rare.
 
It is openly stated that people are sent to labor camps for life if they commit serious crimes.
 
In the city, there are a lot of lifeless buildings (no movement inside, no curtains on the windows, no lights, no furniture inside, etc.) On the first floors of the buildings there are shops sometimes. 98% of them are closed, in 1% of them have someone inside, and 1% are completely empty. We were wondering: how can it be that there's no one in the shop choosing goods or paying for them?
 
During rides to the landmarks outside of Pyongyang, we were mostly traveling by tunnels. Later we realised that these tunnels were laid under small towns. On the one hand, we didn't stop at traffic lights; on the other, we couldn't see other cities aside from the capital. There are very few cars. We mostly saw pretty modern chinese and european models. The cars never give way to pedestrians, not even on the crossings: looks like they're only being driven by party elite, so the regular rabble must step aside. The roads are bad; in fact, max speed on the highway was 70 km/h. There were roadblocks with soldiers. After controlling our passage they saluted to us.
 
In the metro: the cars are pretty similar to those that we had in Moscow in 1950s, but they're a little different. For example, the legs are heated everywhere with hot air. The foreigners were put in a separate car. On the stations the door didn't open for locals.
 
We could see the railroads sometimes. They were all single-track. There were no trains, only one service/repair locomotive.
 
The local beer is truly disgusting, although it's popular booze for locals. The second in popularity is rice vodka with a questionable taste. There was a very bad lager with low percentage (abv 4%) with rotgut notes in taste. There was a restaurant with 8 sorts of the ""best"" beer (yuck!) with differentially proportioned hops, barley, and rice oilcake. They sold the beer to foreigners for $1/bottle. I suppose that locals get it much cheaper.
 
The prices in tourist shops are high, similar to international, like in a duty free zone. Payment – USD cash bills (they don't take coins) and cash yuans.
 
Everyone know or learn by heart the leader's birth day and month, but it's forbidden to know/talk about the leader's age or birth year. Everyone knows that his age will be announced after his death, but before that the leader is forever young. (Right now he's 43 years old.)
 
In a frank conversation, one of the locals said: ""I studied to become an engineer and I did. I started working in that sphere, but then I realised that our tech and science are so backward, that it's just despairing. So I requalified into tourism"".

KEY POINTS:

Port of Los Angeles Sees a 35% Drop in Cargo Traffic: High tariffs on Chinese goods have nearly halted shipments from China, according to Port Executive Director Eugene Seroka. He projected a 35% decrease in cargo arrivals compared to the same time last year.

Ports Handle Over 30% of U.S. Container Trade: The Port of Los Angeles and the neighboring Port of Long Beach together process 31% of all U.S. shipping container imports and exports (17% and 14%, respectively), making their slowdown a critical national issue.

Wider Economic Fallout Includes Job Loss and Supply Chain Slowdown: 1 in 9 jobs in the Los Angeles region is tied to port activity. Experts estimate a 9-12 month long recovery if tariffs are reversed today. As maritime traffic and cargo volume decline, the trucking industry and broader supply chain are also slowing, threatening small businesses and consumer goods availability nationwide. 

—————————————————————————-

FULL ARTICLE:

By Juliette Kayyem

A drop in maritime traffic suggests that the worst is yet to come.

Stock markets plunged for days after President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on imports from around the world. The sell-off ebbed only when he suspended most, but not all, of the new measures for 90 days. The ticker tape is just one indicator of an economy, and other signs are growing more and more ominous—including at the Port of Los Angeles, where high tariffs on China are crushing maritime traffic. “Essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,” Eugene Seroka, the executive director of the port, said on April 24.

Trump views tariffs as essential to rebuilding the manufacturing economy that the United States once had. But his erratic tariff announcements have badly disrupted the economy that the country has today, and that pain is already being felt in the world of logistics.

“These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.”

The Port of Los Angeles, the busiest in the Western Hemisphere, processes about 17 percent of everything the United States imports or exports in shipping containers. The adjoining Port of Long Beach accounts for another 14 percent. Over the years, a whole ecosystem has arisen to support the loading and unloading of the cars, clothes, electronic gadgets, and other things that people want. There are workers and warehouses, trucks and loading pads, security structures and rail lines.
Seroka estimated that cargo arrivals would soon be down 35 percent over the same time last year. At the moment, the drop in traffic seems likelier to accelerate than to reverse. 

The number of cargo ships canceling port calls or entire voyages is on the rise. A number of shipments now under way were instigated before Trump’s so-called Liberation Day tariff announcement, on April 2. According to Forto, a cargo-management and -tracking company, reservations for shipping products must normally be placed two weeks before a cargo vessel launches. The trip from China from California typically takes two or more additional weeks. In other words, the full effects of U.S. tariff policies on maritime traffic may not be apparent for some time.

The economy, and the supply chains that allow it to function, can adjust fairly quickly to certain shocks, including weather disasters and even a pandemic. Early in the COVID shutdowns, toilet paper was in short supply as Americans spent more time at home and less at workplaces and schools. The problem eased as manufacturers ramped up production, transportation systems adapted, and consumer anxiety decreased.
But Trump’s trade war is different because it is unpredictable and indefinite. Even if he were to renounce tariffs tomorrow, Trump has already shaken global confidence in American economic-policy making. No one can comfortably make business decisions based on what he does. Unless the Republican-controlled Congress steps in to quickly take away the president’s ability to impose import duties at will, a failed effortso far, even foreign trading partners who believe they have a deal with the United States could be at risk of capricious new taxes on their products.

Tariffs don’t just reduce the flow of goods coming into the country; they also cause an atrophying of the logistics system that moves products into, out of, and around the United States. “Less cargo volume, less jobs. That’s the rule here,” Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, said recently, describing how one in nine jobs in the greater Los Angeles region arises directly or indirectly from its ports. “Port complexes are like your baby toe on your foot,” Peter Neffenger, the former commander of the Coast Guard sector that includes Los Angeles and Long Beach, told me. “You don’t think about it until you break it one day and realize, ‘I can’t walk.’”

Like the shipping business into and out of Los Angeles, the nationwide trucking industry is slowing down, because drivers have a lot less cargo to move. Without inventory arriving or en route, small businesses will falter; bigger industries will shrink; shelves will be empty.
This week, Trump blamed former President Joe Biden, rather than his own policies, for the recent turmoil on Wall Street. What’s happening in Los Angeles suggests that, if anything, financial markets have yet to fully price in how much Trump’s tariff war is hurting the economy. The stock market goes up and down. Maritime indicators keep on sinking.

post,I just found out the true reason my dad wanted to start a business with me,2023-04-05 15:43:17,"In 2018, my dad told me he was planning to open a plant shop and asked if I wanted to help, since he was still working his full time job and would not have the time to manage the shop. 

Now, my dad LOVES plants. The house is filled with them and he comes home everyday after work to care and check in with them. He's extremely knowledgeable about them too and could tell if a plant was sick and how to treat it without ever having gone to school for it. He told me he really wanted to try it and hoped he could make something out of it. At this point, I had just gotten discharged from the military and wasn't doing much, plus it was rare that he would ask for my help so I said sure. 

Within a week or two, we opened the shop. We planned the prices, the stocks, he taught me the basics of how to take care of various plants, how to make terrariums to sell, and everything else I needed to know to run the shop when he wasn't around. We sold succulents, various flowers, bonsai, seeds, anything we thought looked fun and interesting. He sourced all of that himself. He came by everyday when he had a break from work and even offered delivery services to customers. 

Unfortunately, the shop didn't last long. The rent was expensive and foot traffic was low, so he was essentially bleeding money. Didn't help that he insisted on paying me a full living wage either. Eventually I couldn't bear to see him work so hard and lose so much money and told him I didn't want to do it anymore. The shop then closed and that was that. 

I've always felt bad about how it ended, and regretted how I didn't stick it out longer with this thing he worked so hard for and loved. l decided that once I made enough money in the future I would help him restart this business. 

Cut to a few days ago, I casually asked my mom if my dad ever mentioned anything about starting the business again since he was so into it. She was confused at first, then told me the truth: he didn't start the business because he wanted to, he just wanted me to have something to keep me busy. 

I didn't mention why I was discharged from the military earlier, it was because I had attempted suicide after a severe bout of depression. He came up with the business idea while visiting me at the psych ward, after I mentioned how doing nothing all day makes me feel worse. He heard this little comment of mine and just.. went for it. He knew he was going to lose money, but did it anyway. We're not rich by any means, and he used his savings to do this. 

My mom wasn't supposed to tell me any of this. He knew that if he had told me the truth in the beginning I would have said no because it was too much trouble, and if I found out now I would just feel bad. As long as it was something that helped me, he was okay with things as is. 

I don't know what I'm feeling about this. Like most asian dads and sons, we've never really been affectionate with one another, not with words at least. He's always been more of a silent supporter type, showing up to every achievement and struggle I had. He never said that he cared, but visited me multiple times a day everyday when I was at the psych ward. I want to thank him, but he would be uncomfortable. I want to say I love him, but he would do the boomer equivalent of cringing. I do plan to thank him at some point, but I'm also feeling uncomfortable because that's just not how we do things. 

In the meantime though, thank you dad. I love you.

Edit: I was not expecting this to get so many comments! I posted this last night (in my time zone) and went to bed and woke up overwhelmed by all the responses. Thank you all for your love for my dad, he truly deserves all the love in the world and more. I'm sorry I can't get to reply all your comments but your love and suggestions are felt and heard!

I will thank him, but as many suggested, I will do it in actions. I love the idea of taking him to the botanical garden in my country (thank you to the one who suggested it), and am making plans! I would like to do more (idk if it will ever feel enough haha), so I'm looking into getting more plants and equipment for him. My mom will not be happy at more plant things taking up space but she'll understand. I will also try my best to live a good and happy life as that's important to him as well, as some of you pointed out. 

Speaking of, thank you to the people who wished me well too! I am doing much better than I did in 2017-2018. My dad was definitely one of the biggest reasons that made me keep going, seeing him show up multiple times a day when I was at the psych ward really affected me, knowing how much he cared. I am currently getting a degree in counselling too!

Thank you all again, I hope you're doing well, and remember to give some love to the people around you, however that may be. &lt;3",447,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/12cktr5/i_just_found_out_the_true_reason_my_dad_wanted_to/,low-traffic zones,

I was visiting my mom - she was in her late 80s I think. My daughter called me with a question and my mom would have heard me end with ""..love you too."" And mom complained ""No one tells me they love me."" 

So I told her ""You never told me you loved me."" 

""I wasn't raised that way.""

""Neither was I.""

After that, my kids decided to kill her with kindness and were constantly putting her on the spot - saying ""I love you."" to her, hugging her etc - forcing her to show affection back.

post,"Petition for Chicago 2100, Save and Grow Transit",2025-10-28 17:29:55,"Chicago’s transit is currently facing a drastic fiscal cliff, now is a pivotal time to imagine and shape its future. The choice is stark: Chicago's transit must either grow or face certain death. To escape the impending 2026 budget cuts, the city must fight for an optimistic future. The Chicago 2100 plan is ambitious, yet incrementally achievable that will improve every neighborhood for every Chicagoan, ensuring the city remains vibrant. Sign this petition now to pull transit back from the brink of collapse and demand the world-class system our city deserves. Petition Link: https://c.org/wz8WPSZ8ZD

The city’s fiscal problems are deeper than just transit, with a deep deficit/debt and unsustainable pension obligations. Without increasing the tax base, the fiscal outlook is grim. The city used to be home to more than 1 million more people than today. Most underestimate the downsides of car dependent infrastructure - pollution, traffic death, negative health outcomes, and high infrastructure cost per resident. Our current development prioritizes this low-density car-dependency with uncompetitive transit options. Because of this, the city is traffic-ridden and facing an ever-increasing tax burden. Simply, more people cannot fit in this city without upgrading our infrastructure. With a housing and cost-of-living crisis, Chicago must build! Improving public transportation and promoting transit-oriented-development (TOD) with the Chicago 2100 roadmap is a critical step to alleviate these issues. 

Every addition to the network is an opportunity to increase people’s access to jobs, education, and recreation. The whole city deserves world-class rapid transit. As pictured, CTA should pursue extensions to most “L” lines and promote TOD along them. With the creation of a new teal line along western, cross city connections not centered on the loop are convenient. By bringing the pink line to the old humboldt park alignment, that neighborhood is served and frees up the loop’s capacity. The southside extensions to the green and purple connect currently underserved and underinvested neighborhoods. The brownline connection gives the network easier O’Hare and suburban connections. The orange and yellow extensions connect to popular destination malls and further development opportunities. These alignments help connect every neighborhood more succinctly, without every trip going through the loop. To bridge remaining gaps, bus rapid transit (BRT) with dedicated right-of-way is drastically more cost-effective than rail built along other key corridors. A corridor for Ashland avenue already has a  conceptual design, and a larger scale proof of concept beyond the existing and well-utilized loop link improvements. This would put every resident within a 20 minute walk to true rapid transit, drastically reducing car dependency in even the furthest stretches of the city.

Existing Metra trains are underutilized and under connected for city transport, mainly serving commuters. With new infill stations, comprehensive integration, and improved service, these new crosstown Metra “M” lines would better connect the city with additions to existing infrastructure. Chicago 2100 includes a once proposed suburban connector STAR. Critical backbone projects to the Metra integration are the A2 flyover, St Charles Air Flyover, CHIP (Chicago Hub Improvement), Ogilvie/Union connection, and total electrification.

There are so many hurdles to a plan like this, and it’s easy to write this off as overly-ambitious. These challenges exist, but peer cities have demonstrated it is doable today. Construction costs of transit nationwide are out of control and must be addressed to make this feasible. Along with institutional capacity for design, the city must reform its contracting and consulting models to avoid costs like the Red Line Extension at almost $1B per mile! Adopting standardization of station designs and agency governance consolidation under the RTA are great first steps to mitigate costs. Overcoming local opposition to zoning and parking reforms requires a cultural shift to build trust that expanding transit is the only viable future. Chicago must rise to the occasion to continue to thrive as America's 3rd largest city.

The ambition of Chicago 2100’s transit is grand. It shouldn't stop there, we should inspire equally important projects that improve the city’s transit access and livability, such as: 
- High Speed Rail Hub: The CHIP and regional development can affirm Chicago’s place as the vibrant center of a Midwest rail system. Shoutout to HSR Alliance for their advocacy.
- Rail Infrastructure Upgrades: Straightening alignment / removing slow-zones, Removal of All At-Grade intersections, aforementioned Metra flyovers and connections, Track platform screen doors, and upgraded Station amenities.
- Trails and Corridors: Chicago Riverwalk extension and wild mild integration, Wacker Dr Green Belt, 606 extension, Boulevard Enhancement, Englewood Nature Trail, Kenwood rail to trail conversion, and so many more
- Highway caps: Cap the Kennedy and Cap DSLSD in Grant Park
- City-wide Neighborhood Pedestrian/Bike Infrastructure: Curb bump outs, raised crosswalks, lower speed limit, and so much more identified by CDOT. Shoutout to BetterStreetsChicago for their advocacy.

Please leave any constructive suggestions below. Shoutout to MetroMapMaker for the web tool, however this inherently limits the design of any suggestions. I would love to improve on this and make it into a formal proposal that also ties into the Central Area plan and CMAP’s 2050 vision!

# NEW FOR APEX LEGENDS: LEGACY

# ARENAS

https://preview.redd.it/8kvjmz57b5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3650b78eeb12fd0f9eb04d449f6bff79da58a1a

The Games are going underground with the introduction of a new permanent mode: Arenas. Fully reassembled and unimpressed with the glitz and glamor of the Apex Games, former Apex Predator Ash is taking the competition back to its roots. A purer form of combat.

The rules are simple: 3-versus-3. Eliminate your enemies to win the round. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You win, or you die.

Arenas features a new set of custom maps, tailor-made for close-quarters combat (with more to come in the future). Squads start each round in a spawn room, where they can get weapons, gear, and abilities, and adjust their loadout as their strategy changes. The first team to win three rounds with at least a two-point lead will be crowned the victor—unless they battle to a four-four tie. Then they’ll have the honor of participating in Ash’s favorite part of the game: Sudden Death.

For more on Arenas, [check out the blog](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/introducing-arenas) for a full deep dive into the new mode.

# PARTY CRASHER

*Short version, Mirage took the voyage on a joyride and it didn’t go as planned.*

https://preview.redd.it/ix4p3yp9b5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdaf64eb31613e968aeba9a02300394c3d51ac28

**Party Crasher** is one of two exciting custom arenas where you’ll be able to show off your skills. This arena takes place in a ritzy, downtown plaza where players can choose to engage on the crashed Mirage Voyage, or the opulent two story buildings that make up the downtown. Stay vigilante, as this map hosts a variety of engagement distances—both close quarters and long distance.

&amp;#x200B;

# PHASE RUNNER

*The Phase Runner on Olympus is unique, but it wasn’t the first of its kind.*

https://preview.redd.it/wvgq17wbb5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b9344fe92e951ff0dd06890457fd5ae995be3d9

**Phase Runner** is the second of our custom arenas, and our largest. You’ll fight in a hidden, experimental zone at the peak of a mountain where a prototype phase runner lays for use. This map gives you a lot of space to maneuver, so be sure to be on the lookout for those who prefer to be patient and take you out from afar. Sound tactics and clear communication are what you’ll need to come out on top as you fight through the construction site or near the phase runner exit.

In addition to the two new maps, other areas from our three BR maps will be thrown into a bi-weekly rotation, giving you five maps total for Arenas. At the start you’ll get **Artillery** from Kings Canyon, **Thermal Station** from World’s Edge, and **Golden Gardens** from Olympus.

# VALKYRIE

[https://youtu.be/PJYy-e3kXnU](https://youtu.be/PJYy-e3kXnU)

Kairi Imahara, the daughter of Apex Predator Viper, salvaged the remains of her father's Northstar Titan years after his death. With Rampart's help, she fashioned it into a sleek new jetpack that honors her family’s legacy. Now, she’s entered the Games under the name **VALKYRIE**.

**Passive: VTOL Jets**

Use your jetpack to reposition or reach high places. You have limited fuel and cannot use weapons while flying.

**Tactical: Missile Swarm**

Fire a swarm of mini-rockets which damage and disorient the enemy.

**Ultimate: Skyward dive**

Take to the skies to reposition a long distance across the map. Your squadmates can join in.

**Class: Recon**

Scanning Survey Beacons reveals the next circle’s location.

&amp;#x200B;

# BOCEK

https://preview.redd.it/cs3yig1hb5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=509ba33d442859512d101dc2a73bbc5aff9c1b1a

The new **Bocek** (pronounced *bow-check*) compound bow is a precision marksman weapon that rewards a skilled and confident hand. Holding down fire will draw the bow over a short time, increasing the power of the shot, with maximum power giving optimal damage and projectile speed. Repeatedly firing the Bocek right as it reaches max power provides the best sustained damage. 

The Bocek uses a new ammo type, Arrows, which are unique to this weapon. Arrows are more rare on the battlefield, but fired arrows will stick into surfaces and remain in the world for players to pick back up and reuse. The 1x hcog classic, 1x holosight, 2x hcog, 1x-2x variable, and 3x hcog optics can all be equipped. The Bocek can also be further modified with the two new hop-ups entering the game, Shatter Caps and Deadeye’s Tempo; it can even equip both hop-ups simultaneously!

# OLYMPUS - THE LOST FLEET UPDATE

https://preview.redd.it/pk2pq4uib5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb7d0de54e36b96cbb8fb472fb72539883b8c6e6

A fleet of mysterious ships have made their way to Olympus and brought with them an otherworldly, parasitic plant that has begun to take root along the surface. The lead ship, The Icarus, has docked with the city and changed the landscape for good. Fight through the claustrophobic halls of the ghost ship, search corpses for a mysterious key card, and walk away as the last squad standing.

Read [our latest map update blog](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/olympus-map-update) to get a detailed look at what’s changed on Olympus.

To allow everyone to see the latest map update, Olympus will be the only map in rotation for the first week of the new season.

# STARTER KIT AND LOOT CHANGES

https://preview.redd.it/14o3ixpkb5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6210ace546fed8e6f30c33e8aabf80201993ce

* Players will now start a match with a “Starter Kit” consisting of a Level 1 EVO Shield, Helmet, and Knockdown Shield, plus two Shield Cells and Syringes each.
* We’ve removed Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the loot pool.
* Spawn chances for Level 1 EVO Shields in the loot pool have been significantly reduced.
* Along with the lowered or removed spawn chances for these items, we’ve rebalanced the loot pool such that higher-level versions of these items will appear nearly the same as they do now, but other item types will appear more often (weapons, ordinance, health, ammo, etc.)

***Dev note****We've wanted to take a crack at improving the loot game for a while, with our design goals being to make picking up loot feel more impactful to the game, and to thin out our loot a bit in general, since we're always adding new items to the pool. The recent Locked &amp; Loaded takeover mode helped us field-test some of the changes we're looking to make moving forward: certain pieces of loot, and low-tier loot types specifically, are being put on notice.*

*We're removing Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields from the ground loot because these seemed like the least exciting, least meaningful equipment pickups we had. Their power is practically invisible, so they don't really feel like a character improvement in the way that things like, say, a Backpack feels (getting those extra slots feels SO chunky!).*

*We're keeping Level 1 EVO Shields in the loot pool (albeit at a lower spawn chance) in addition to adding them to your starter kit because having them sprinkled around is still important for ""shield-swapping"" shenanigans.*

*Finally, granting these pieces of gear from the start of the game is also intended to improve the ""hot drop"" situation: having more health, some headshot damage reduction, and a little knockdown protection can help give players some more time to react to a chaotic hot drop than before.*

*Be on the lookout for more loot changes in the future! This will be an ongoing project.*

&amp;#x200B;

# EMOTES

https://reddit.com/link/n19dbs/video/87l9h5bob5w61/player

Introducing **Emotes**! Every Legend will have one emote unlocked at launch and additional emotes can be obtained through Apex packs or by crafting them. Equip your emotes to the emote wheel and flex away! It’s great fun to show off to your squadmates in the starting room of Arenas, and of course you have to use them on the Winner’s podium.

Now, since emotes kick your camera back to a third-person view, we know some folks are already thinking about corner peeking. Competitive integrity is still paramount, so enemies that your character couldn’t see in first-person view will not be shown while you are in third person.

This video shows the “Anti-Peek” feature working on the purple Dummie behind the rock. Without it, Pathfinder would be able to use the 3rd person camera to gain knowledge that he shouldn’t have. All emotes have Anti-Peek enabled and there is no way to disable it.

&amp;#x200B;

# LEGEND UPDATES

# LOW PROFILE CHARACTERS

* Low profile no longer exists! This trait has been removed from Wraith, Lifeline, and Wattson.

***Dev Note***

*After our successful experiment with Wraith's hitboxes, we are now confident that we can solve balance issues between smaller and larger Legends through changes to their kits and hitboxes. It is finally time for Low Profile to go the way of the dodo. (Sorry dodos.)*

&amp;#x200B;

## LIFELINE

* **Combat Revive**: No longer deploys a shield. Can now revive two players at the same time. Can now cancel active revives in progress to allow your teammate to defend themselves with their knockdown shield.
* **D.O.C. Heal Drone**: Heal rate increased from 5hp per second to 8hp per second. Deployment time before healing begins reduced by roughly 33%.
* **Care Package**: Cooldown reduced from 6 minutes to 5 minutes. Now guarantees an upgrade (if possible) in three categories: Body Shield, Other Equipment (Helmet, Backpack, and Knockdown Shield), and Weapon Attachment, based on your team’s current gear when the Package arrives.

***Dev Note***

*Lifeline’s kit was not in a particularly healthy place. The Passive shield was extremely strong to the point of frustration, while her Tactical and Ultimate seemed like they were becoming more and more obsolete. These changes are aimed to redistribute this big power differential between all of her abilities, making D.O.C. and Care Package more powerful and effective, while tamping down on the highly binary and situational Combat Revive.*

&amp;#x200B;

## OCTANE

* **Stim**: Reduced cooldown between stims from 4s to 1s. Increased health cost from 12hp to 20hp.
* Increased bullet spread while in the air and shooting from the low **Launch Pad** trajectory.

***Dev Note***

*Octane continues to perform really well after the latest changes. Too well? We still love the frequency of the Jump Pad, but we’d like to make using Stim something Octane thinks about doing at the right time, instead of always slamming it by default.*

&amp;#x200B;

## LOBA

* **Burglar's Best Friend**: Can now run and slide at full speed while aiming the bracelet and while the bracelet is in the air. Loba will no longer be slowed after translocating.
* Fixed a lot of bugs that caused bracelet tosses to fail.

**Black Market Boutique**: Increased cooldown from 90s to 120s.

&amp;#x200B;

## HORIZON

* **Gravity Lift:** Reduced lift speed by 30%. Reduced side-to-side acceleration. Limited the time you can sit at the top of Gravity Lift to 2 seconds. Increased cooldown from 15s to 20s.
* Horizon’s abilities will now get zapped by Wattson pylons.

***Dev Note***

*Horizon is powerful and popular, but that's not why we're making these changes. We believe that mistakes in Apex Legends should be punishable, and when Horizon could just get herself out of bad positioning while popping a whole battery, this just wasn't true. These changes have two goals: 1) make it much more possible for enemies to shoot Horizon as she sits in her gravity lift and 2) make gravity lift less of an impromptu sniper tower.*

&amp;#x200B;

## FUSE

* **Knuckle Cluster:** Fuse now has two stacks of Knuckle Cluster. Reduced cooldown from 25s to 20s.

***Dev Note***

*More help is coming, but we want to be very careful how we buff him so that he doesn't just become the Legend that kills you with his abilities.*

&amp;#x200B;

## BANGALORE

* **Smoke Launcher:** Thickened Bangalore’s smoke. 

***Dev Note***

*Last patch we optimized Bangalore’s smoke particles and inadvertently thinned them out. This aims to get her back to the original visuals while keeping the optimizations.*

&amp;#x200B;

## BLOODHOUND

* No longer receives assists from **Eye of the Allfather**.

***Dev Note***

*Bloodhound's scan is strong, but the goal of this change in particular is to reconsider assists and their implications for Ranked Points. There's enough intrinsic value in sonar scans, and it's a slippery slope to consider crediting assists for other non-damaging abilities. Crypto will remain an exception. The active nature of Crypto's drone scan is notably different from the passive option with Bloodhound. This should encourage Bloodhound players to act on the information they get from the scan, to eliminate instances where they might try to snag a quick assist without committing to a fight in the same way Crypto has to.*

&amp;#x200B;

## CRYPTO

* Crypto's drone can now scan and open care packages.
* Can no longer use his drone to ""hijack"" a respawn beacon that's already in use.

&amp;#x200B;

# WEAPONS UPDATES

# MARKSMAN WEAPON CATEGORY

https://preview.redd.it/w7wdt3hzb5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44009696b7afe8f8ebd9b3bd7ddbbac2ad248686

The G7 Scout and the 30-30 are currently in the Assault Rifle weapons category, but they are a bit strange in that category due to their firing style and some of their handling values. Similarly, the Triple Take felt a little out of place in the Sniper category.

With the introduction of the Bocek bow, we felt it was a good time to introduce a new weapons category, Marksman Weapons, which will include the G7, 30-30, Triple Take, and Bocek. Weapons in this category are precision weapons that are most effective up to medium-long range, and are the sort of in-betweens of Assault Rifles and Snipers. This allows us to begin moving the settings of these weapons towards more consistent value for the class, and make the settings of ARs and Snipers more consistent with less outliers.

For starters, we are increasing the movement speed while aiming down sights for marksman weapons; They were at sniper speeds, and will now be between sniper and AR speeds. Additionally, we have done some targeted normalization of hipfire spread amounts.

&amp;#x200B;

# SUPPLY DROP ROTATION

https://preview.redd.it/e1nj15l1c5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c6b0e0aa8268b76550b8d256377c6946d0fc8fc

This season, we’re taking the Peacekeeper out of the supply drop and putting the Triple Take in its place. Of course, with any supply drop change, these weapons will have their stats updated. See how each weapon changes down below.

**Crate Weapon Drop Rates:**Since we are exchanging a shotgun with a marksman weapon, now was a good time to rebalance the drop rates of crate weapons. The Kraber will spawn less often in the early game and more often in the mid game to better accommodate its power. The Triple Take will be the most common early game crate weapon, with the Prowler being the most prominent late game crate weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

# FULLY KITTED ROTATION

https://preview.redd.it/jy9sr113c5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d161c8aaafa1ef2338227cab8e30c3f4d3627bc2

* Added: Wingman, Bocek, R99, Hemlock, and Sentinel
* Removed: R301, 30-30 Repeater, Mozambique, Longbow DMR, and Spitfire

&amp;#x200B;

# HOP UPS

Shatter Caps - Fire select to toggle between standard mode and shatter mode. In shatter mode, rounds split into a blast pattern on firing. This hop up will be equipable to the 30-30 Repeater and the Bocek.  

Deadeye’s Tempo - Firing at the perfect moment increases fire rate. This can currently be attached to the Sentinel and the Bocek. 

* To make room, the Hammerpoint and Skullpiercer hop ups are being vaulted for now, and won’t be available.

&amp;#x200B;

# ASSAULT RIFLES

Reducing the headshot multiplier for all assault rifles from 2.0 to 1.75

***Dev Note***

*This was already the case for the Hemlok, so the affected guns are the R301, Flatline, and Havoc.*

&amp;#x200B;

## PEACEKEEPER

* It comes with the Precision Choke by default, which can be toggled off
* Pellet damage reduced from 10 to 9
* Rechamber time increased from 0.9 seconds to 1.1 seconds
* Reload times increased (regular from 2.45 to 2.5, empty from 3.35 to 3.5)
* Pellet spread increased in general, and spread when charged increased for all charge levels (from 0.65/0.45/0.2 to 0.85/0.65/0.35)
* Quickly loses charge after leaving ADS

***Dev Note***

*Since the Peacekeeper is coming out of the crate, we are bringing many of the stats back in line with their previous values. We are also reducing its damage potential and bringing in the effective range a bit since the Precision Choke is always available now.*

&amp;#x200B;

## TRIPLE TAKE

* As a crate weapon, it will come with a 9 ammo clip and 63 reserve ammo
* Fire rate increased from 1.2 to 1.3
* Time to full charge reduced from 1.1 seconds to 1 second
* Retains charge briefly after leaving ADS
* Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs
* Increased spread while airborne and aiming down sights

&amp;#x200B;

## HAVOC

* Increased recoil controllability early in the pattern

***Dev Note*** 

*This should help make up for the reduced headshot multiplier and make it a bit more usable in mid-range fights.*

&amp;#x200B;

## SPITFIRE

* Reduced recoil controllability early in the pattern

***Dev Note****The Spitfire is too strong at the moment, boasting good damage output with low recoil. Making it a bit harder to control early in the pattern should give more time for opponents to fight against it. That said, we’re prepared to make more changes to the Spitfire if it remains too powerful.*

&amp;#x200B;

## 30-30 REPEATER

* Increased leg damage multiplier from 0.75 to 0.85
* Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs

***Dev Note***

*The 30-30 could use some love, so we’re bringing up the amount of leg damage it does.  This should make it a bit more consistent without raising its high “best case” damage potential.*

&amp;#x200B;

## G7 SCOUT

* Move-speed while aiming down sights has been increased to match other marksman weapons -- faster than snipers, slower than ARs
* Increased hipfire spread size (reduced accuracy) to be more in line with other marksman weapons

***Dev Note***

*The 30-30 Repeater and the Bocek Compound Bow have more accurate hipfire than the baseline marksman weapon values, so the G7 Scout will be less accurate in hipfire than these other weapons.*

&amp;#x200B;

## LONGBOW

* Increased headshot multiplier from 2.0 to 2.15

&amp;#x200B;

## WINGMAN

* Increased headshot multiplier from 2.0 to 2.15

***Dev Note***

*As we’ve done before when the Skullpiercer is out of the loot pool, we’re giving the Longbow and Wingman a compensatory buff.*

&amp;#x200B;

## MOZAMBIQUE

* Increased magazine capacity from 4 to 6
* Moved the lower 2 pellets inward in the blast pattern

***Dev Note***

*This brings up the baseline power level so “only” finding a Mozambique early in the match gives you more of a fighting chance, and makes up for the removal of Hammerpoints.*

&amp;#x200B;

## P2020

* Increased bullet damage from 15 to 18
* Lowered fire rate from 8.5 to 6.25

***Dev Note***

*Similar to the Mozambique, we want to bring up the P2020’s baseline power level a bit. Most players couldn’t take advantage of the fast fire rate, so bringing that down while increasing the damage should help players win more early fights with the P2020.*

&amp;#x200B;

## ARC STARS

* Aim and movement slow removed from the initial stick.

***Dev Note***

*Sticking someone should feel rewarding, considering it's a rare occurrence that's difficult to pull off. While an argument can be made that getting stuck should be a personal death sentence, the inability to at least relocate and spare teammates from the follow-up explosion makes it hard to counter against a coordinated team. This change should help mitigate that without stripping away the satisfaction of hitting a nice stick.*

&amp;#x200B;

# QUALITY OF LIFE

* Badges are now sorted by categories and can be filtered by “all” or “unlocked only”. This suggestion came directly from players. Thank you! It’s so much better!

https://preview.redd.it/7rztnsxcc5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff803a3ad29452cdf778b460943ee8b62578938a

&amp;#x200B;

* When looting death boxes, players can now see health bars for everyone on the team.

https://preview.redd.it/ym4vlk5fc5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=081e29d4cec60e071f7e52fa41d30c7ace6b9aa4

* Challenges can now be “favorited” by going into the challenges menu and right clicking a challenge. That Challenge will then be added to a new favorites tab that will appear in the lobby and in the match’s map screen.

https://preview.redd.it/mtkabnogc5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=681b19efec88233d83c18ffadd668134f61df8e8

* Pressing and Holding F2 while in-game will bring up the ability description page for your character. This is only available on PC.
* Players can now request better equipment by going into their inventory and pinging a piece of equipment.
* Your first Challenge Reroll of the day is now free.
* Rerolling your challenges will allow you to choose from either BR-focused challenges or Arenas-focused ones.
* Holo Sprays, Quips, and Emotes, can be favorited. These will be used whenever the player is prompted to do a random emote.
* **Club Invites v2:** You can now include what you want to play when you send your clubmates a party invite via the Club tab. Select as many club mates as you want to send the invite to at once via the member list.
* **Ranked:** Fixed edge cases where an abandon penalty would be incorrectly applied due to server errors.
* **Flight path adjustments:** Removing edge dropship flight paths to prevent matches where large portions of the map receive little to no traffic. These screenshots show a before/after comparison of possible flight paths on Kings Canyon.

https://preview.redd.it/khyjnh5ic5w61.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cca84fef03b4b6e1f47d091ed4063f222bf716da

# 

# RING UPDATE

We're continuing work from the Fight Night update to improve match pacing towards the end of the game. We're slowing down the closing speed of the late game Rings to allow you more time to fight and maneuver your way into the Ring. We're also reducing the ""waiting"" time before Rings 4 and 6 start to close.

* Ring 4 pre-shrink time reduced from 2:00 to 1:45
* Ring 4 shrink speed reduced from 33 second close time to 40 seconds
* Ring 5 shrink speed reduced from 20 second close time to 40 seconds
* Ring 6 pre-shrink time reduced from 1:30 to 1:00
* Ring 6 shrink speed reduced from 1:40 close time to 2:00

&amp;#x200B;

 &gt; Sorry, we try to cut things down for brevity when possible, and sometimes it gets a little confusing. Let me rephrase!

 &gt; I personally really love the hammerpoints! That's why they've been in since S3 while other things have come and gone :)

 &gt; I wrote a big comment on it above, but it was mostly as a result of the P2020 and Moz buffs. Long story short, because of buffing the base weapons, we would have to nerf the hopup's power so it wasn't OP -- it's a very strong hopup, the big weaknesses are what keep it in check.

 &gt; Yes. Organization - or lack thereof - was a big limiter here. Hard to add more badges when you couldn't even sort them. With that said, we have actually expanded badges quite a bit.

 &gt;I love this idea. And we certainly have discussed it. I wouldn't say ""*in the works*"" but definitely something that's on the table.

 &gt; I do think it'd be neat. I spend a lot of time actually looking at old skins in dev builds internally. I wouldn't want it to be more frustrating. But I do like the idea of a ""vault"" or ""museum"" of sorts rather than making people google the old skins...

Biggest issue on how many countries have set up globalization is every job is mainly in the city. Most people can't afford to live close to their jobs so they drive insanely long distances to them everyday, a perfect example is California drives doing 3 hour commutes to work everyday because that was the only affordable place they could find. Isolation is going to hit these places hard!! Many people's everyday choices are going to become highly limited over night with this stupid tax. Everything from food to jobs is going to become can I afford to do it. The people hit hardest by this will be everyone living on the fringes of the city with limited at best public transportation and access to jobs and basics like stores for food and clothes.

comment,,2019-04-08 17:12:01,Not from England but over most of the US a lot of rural towns are becoming isolated traps. The town I grew up in the only jobs you can get there now is running moonshine or meth or making the stuff. Nearest store is 40 minutes by interstate so people go without on a lot of things. Only example I can think of to compare what your saying on how things are going is Kentucky. West Kentucky is where most of the economy is for the state and where most of the funding goes. East Kentucky is so destitute you wonder what part of the 1800s your in.

Thirty minutes.

That’s all fate needed.

That’s all the time we had before our lives became inexplicably intertwined.

Whether by the cold and callous hands of statistical probability rearing its ugly head in the form of dumb coincidence, or whether it was *actually* fate, the end result remains the same.

That fateful night, those thirty minutes, it was all it took for the lives of so many to be turned upside down.

From family to business and all those caught in the crossfire, my presence had led to this — the disruption of livelihoods and aspirations.

I didn’t like Lartia. Not one bit, not especially after he showed his colors.

But did he deserve to die?

I can’t say.

Because it’s neither my *right* nor *prerogative* to judge.

What I do know, however, is that those under his ‘care’, employ, or whatever you might call it… *they all didn’t deserve the ramifications of his death*.

A familiar feeling of gross negligence, of *personal* responsibility started welling up within me again.

A strong sense of uncompromising culpability, even if it was misplaced, blanketed my very being.

The highs of victory and the calmness that came with our triumph over the vorpal chimera — all of it — was smothered by this cold and gut-churning feeling.

This feeling of complete and utter guilt.

What made it worse, however, was that I was staring straight into Solizia’s eyes all the while; eyes which were currently filled with gratitude, gratefulness, and a sense of indebtedness.

I didn’t feel worthy of any of it.

…

But this wasn’t the time to feel bad for myself.

*If you screw up, own it. There’s always time for self-reflection, but try not to cross the boundary between moping and inaction. Call me a bit old fashioned for it, Emma, or call it whatever you will. Just know that in life, you’ve gotta own your mistakes by making it up to those that you owe.*

I needed to make things right.

With a deep breath and a steadying hand, I quickly turned towards Thalmin.

His features, whilst lacking the guilt-ridden expression I wore, still betrayed a slight surprise that came with the Lord Lartia revelation.

We exchanged a knowing glance, or at least that’s how I saw it, because not a single word of  explanation was exchanged before he gave me a small nod — signalling a go-ahead for whatever it was I had in store next.

“Solizia.” I began with a dour breath.

“Yes, Sir Knight?”

“I…” I paused, my mind wracking with indecision.

At least, that was the case until I spotted Etholin’s little unopened gift pouch strapped to one of my travel packs.

A lightbulb moment hit me.

And I chose *action* instead of a stream of empty platitudes.

“Have you ever considered working for an adjacent realmer?” 

This question prompted a raise then a furrowing of the man’s brows, as if he wasn’t at all expecting this non-sequitor of a half-offer.

“Erm, I apologize Sir Knight. But the life of a porter is perhaps beyond my skills, capabilities, and experience. The fact I also have a son makes it such that this… *adventurous* lifestyle wouldn’t at all fit my current—”

“Oh, no. That’s not what I was asking.” I quickly shot the man’s concerns down with two open palms. “We’re not in the market for porters. So I was just asking in general if you guys — being Nexian locals — would ever consider working for an adjacent realmer in the same capacity that you were under Lord Lartia.”

This clarification caused a clear shift in the man’s expressions, his eyes narrowing at the prospects. “As… carters under contract?”

“Yeah! Erm, I’m not exactly sure how adjacent noble business would work in the Nexus, but I do have a friend who seems to be operating a business out of Elaseer — a specialty store of some kind. So as with any store, I’m assuming there *has* to be some sort of logistics involved in stocking inventory, right?” I turned to Thalmin who merely furrowed his brows and shrugged blankly in my direction. 

“Erm, regardless! I’m sure he’ll have *some* sort of a role for you! And from the way you’ve described it, being employed by a noble sure beats going indie, right?”

That point of further clarification drove the man into even *deeper* thought, his eyes bouncing back and forth between me and Thalmin.

“I suppose it would.” He acknowledged. “And though there *might* be certain naysayers over the idea of Nexians — commoners as we may be — taking up contractual employment under an adjacent merchant house… such social stigmas are outweighed by the practical boons of being under contract. Namely, the guarantee of a steady source of income.” 

A smile grew across my face as I turned to Thalmin—

“However—”

—though this was tempered as quickly as it arose.

“—I doubt this will elevate us out of our *physical* travails.""

I cocked my head in confusion before it finally hit me.

“You’ll still be locked out of the transportium network because *Adjacent Realmers* don’t have access to it…” I reasoned out loud. 

“That will most likely be the case, yes.” Solizia acknowledged with a nod as I readied my spirits for another nosedive. 

“But of course… I am not an elf to **\[look a gift horse in the mouth. 87.23% Accuracy.\]**” He explained to the tune of a working translation error. “I have **\[learned to wear my pride like a coat. 19.27% Accuracy.\]**” The translation continued, though this latter analogy left *much* to be desired. 

The lack of an immediate response, or perhaps the slip of Low Nexian, quickly clued Solizia into the conversation’s climax being lost in translation; prompting the elf to quickly clarify.

“Which is to say, my pride is of least concern now. Only to be worn after first being clothed in the undershirts of practicality.” He elaborated, prompting the EVI to let out an affirmative beep in response.

**New esoteric colloquialism added to the \[Working Language Database\].**

“I apologize, Sir Knight, I… may be becoming too much of a back tavern poet in my excitement.” He continued with a nervous laugh.

“So… can I take this as a *yes*, or do you need more time to think about it?” I responded softly.

The elf smiled softly in response, his eyes shifting momentarily towards the eerily *empty* night sky above, before once more locking eyes with my lenses.

“There is nothing to think about.” He stated bluntly. “Especially when the winds of fate have aligned with such poise and purpose. My answer is a resounding *yes*, Sir Knight.” The elf acknowledged with a deep dip of his head.

“It’s really alright, Solizia. Please, there’s no need for the whole song and dance.” I attempted to rebuff his display of deference with yet another set of raised hands. “Just contact me when you get back to Elaseer and I’ll hook you up with my guy.” I smiled warmly.

“Forgive my ignorance, Sir Knight, but in which manner shall I contact you?” 

I instinctively reached for my tablet, only to be hit with that now familiar sensation that I’d trained hard to overcome — *the familiarity of perpetual interconnectedness and the loss of connection to the greater infosphere*.

It hadn’t *really* come up before, at least, not to this extent. Everyone who I *needed* to be in touch with was always in arm’s reach or a castle’s jog away.

It was only Rila that bucked this trend and even so, she offered that bracelet that more or less acted as a primitive stand-in for this sort of thing.

Solizia’s situation, however, was the first where I was faced with the *widening* of the world. Where distances actually *felt* like distances, not just vague suggestions to be overcome via a call, chat, or heck, even a ‘face to face’ virtual meetup.

Somehow, the challenges that came with this deceptively simple question felt more extreme than keeping in touch with the Lunarian and Spacer friends I made on that pilgrimage up to the moon.

This… fundamental systemic incongruency hit far harder than just being *disconnected* from the infosphere.

No.

This… this was well and truly the first time where I *felt* the sheer *distances* that we’d conquered being unraveled before my very eyes.

And it was here, in this moment, where I understood far better than any bland lecture or infographic could convey; *why* the GUN had always placed not just communications, but *seamless interconnectedness*, as a fundamental basic aspect of the P-MASLs.

Because without it… distances became not just a logistical barrier but a *social* barrier too.

“Maybe you could send us a letter to the Academy once you arrive?” I finally offered, my mind *immediately* going to the closest approximation for modern communications infrastructure that I knew Nexian commoners had access to.

But that thought was quickly shot down by the lupinor prince. “No. Despite the guarantee of privacy, the sheer *presence* of a letter from a Nexian commoner would raise suspicions, Emma.” Thalmin interjected.

“You’re right.” I acknowledged. “Then… what about those guys Ilunor has contacts with? The BOWmen or whatever it was?”

Solizia’s eyes widened as a shiver visibly ran down his spine. “If I may be so selfish to proclaim… I wish nothing to do with those types, Sir Knight.”

“Right…” I acknowledged with a sigh, before Thalmin simply came in with a rather *straightforward* answer.

“Why don’t we just have Solizia contact Lord Esila directly through his store?” He reasoned. “Have Etholin’s clerks be forewarned about Solizia’s arrival, and simply contact us *that* way.” 

“Brilliant idea, Thalmin!” I responded with a glowing smile. “Right then! Solizia! Here’s what you’re going to do…”

The next few minutes were abound with a flurry of back and forth references to maps and names. Though thankfully, all of that was expedited by the aid of Solizia’s own experience with the town and his familiarity with basically *all* of the major shops, both in commoner town and in the noble quarter.

Eventually, we settled what back home *would* have just been a simple exchange of contact details.

And of course, came the awkward question as to—

“—why are you doing this, Sir Knight? You… have neither the incentive nor an obligation to do so. This is not a question of your moral imperative, nor your character, but merely a query.”

“And a pertinent one at that, I admit.” I acknowledged with a sigh. 

A part of me wanted to spill the beans.

Another part of me, however, understood well the sorts of implications that would have on not only the ongoing investigation, but what tenuous ‘balance’ we had back at the Academy between the Dean and the Goldthorn.

*Adding variable factors into the mix is the last thing on my agenda*… I thought to myself.

Which meant that I simply had to walk around it, as best as I could. 

“I just want to do what’s right. That’s… sort of how things work back home. Lending a helpful hand, pulling up our most vulnerable, lifting those who’ve fallen on rough patches. All of it’s just what we do. Well… at least most of us. But this especially applies to the sorts of folks in my position, and the oaths we swore to uphold the sanctity and dignity of human — er sapient — life.” I started earnestly.  “And to those ends, please drop the whole life debt thing, alright? I… just want to set things right for you and your son’s life.” 

Solizia went silent for a long while. His eyes were in pensive thought… though whatever responses he was contemplating would forever be his to know as he quickly dropped them with a sigh and a deep bow. “As you wish, Blue Knight. You have my utmost gratitude regardless.”

He sat there silently for a moment, before Thalmin sensed this and quickly dismissed the man with a flick of his wrist; the elf retired to his cart soon after.

A still silence filled the air after that, as the crackles of the campfire ushered in a new sense of calm.

A calm that was only possible after I’d at least *attempted* at fixing what I’d broken just by my mere *arrival*.

“What you did was brash and foolhardy.” Thalmin finally uttered out, his voice teetering on a stern lecture. “But oftentimes, that’s what doing the right thing entails.” He quickly changed his tune, letting out a small sigh all the while. “Thacea might have something else to say about this. I know Ilunor definitely would. But from my flawed and very biased perspective? You performed well in tonight’s act in the theater of life.” Thalmin cackled out, once more trying his hand at an Ilunor impersonation at the tail end of that compliment.

“Yeah, well… there was nothing much for me to risk here aside from the whole investigation thing.” I shrugged. “But that was easy enough to dodge.”

“Investigation? Oh, no. I meant to imply that to the eyes of most, you have just wasted a perfectly good reciprocal token on a random stranger. Er, a **\[favor card. 99.87% Accuracy.\]**, as you once put it.” 

It took me a moment to understand what Thalmin was getting at.

But once I realized it, I immediately facepalmed. “Ohhhhhh. Right… you mean to say I’ve used up my favors with Etholin because of this job recommendation thing?”

“Yes.” Was Thalmin’s only response.

“Right. Well… they say that money well spent is money you don’t regret spending… or at least I think that’s the ancient phrase for it.” I shrugged. “There’s always more *social favors* to be earned or whatnot. Might as well spend some on the stuff that matters.”

“Forgive me for saying this, Emma, but that phrase sounds like it emerged from the monarch of all spendthrifts.” 

“Eh… say what you want about that era, but a heck of a lot of great phrases — many of them cautionary — came out of that period of time where many of those warnings *did* come to pass.” I shrugged. “But we eventually grew and learned from it, so that’s all well and good.” 

“I see…” Thalmin’s eyes narrowed once more as he leaned in closer towards the fire and, by extension, towards me.

“You *must* tell me more of these times, Emma. In exchange for my own tales, of course. For as *troubling* as they were… I find all aspects of history to be insightful in their own right.” Thalmin spoke. The tone of his *request* bordered on a royal command; a sense of authority that came naturally to the princely wolf.

“I’m assuming you want a focus on the *military* side of things too, my prince?” 

That response — especially the latter statement — was enough to throw Thalmin off of his carefully laid trajectory, repeating the same effect it had on Thacea just a week or so earlier.

Though to his credit, his recovery was far more slick, as he took that tease in stride with a cackle and a smile.

“Am I that much of an open book?” He snickered back.

“Nah, well… you’re earnest, which I guess in the Nexus has just about the same meaning.” I shot back with a friendly jab. “But in all seriousness, you’ve shown your colors on the topic many times before, Thalmin. So I’ll be happy to divulge… for a price, though.” I added teasingly.

“Oh? Learning the Nexian vernacular now are we?” The prince shot back with the same coy tone of voice.

“Hey, when in Rome am I right?” I responded. The EVI’s translation of that saying clearly landed well as Thalmin responded with a nod of his own.

“Name your price.” Thalmin spoke wryly with a cross of his arms.

“Let’s start with something I find to be topical. Magical telecommunications. From what the library told me a while back during the whole *radio* exchange, it mentioned something about Tethers, Flares, and Puddlejumpers. I’m assuming these are like… the fundamental analogues to instantaneous or at least near-instantaneous communications using magic, correct?”

“They *are*, yes.” Thalmin nodded. “Though… we *will* be learning this in class regardless. Under Status Communicatia or some such. Are you sure you want me to touch on this now?”

“Eh. It wouldn’t hurt, right?” I offered with a shrug. “But just the basics. It *is* getting late and I’m actually starting to feel the grip of exhaustion muffling my brain.”

“Understandable. Mind you, I mostly focus on the *practical* aspects of these systems, so be forewarned.” Thalmin prefaced with a toothy yawn. “You can divide these three systems by the intent behind their function or, more accurately, by *scale*. Tethers act similarly to minor shards of impart in that they are typically two enchanted artifices, bound together permanently, with the capability of conveying sound, script, or even projections over vast distances. Flares are much the same, albeit now a sort of *web*…” Thalmin paused, as if waiting to gauge my reaction on that particular word. “... of such artifices. Multiple, connected through a complicated **web** of intersecting enchantments.” He continued, once more emphasizing that word for added effect. “Finally, puddlejumpers are… well… it’s actually quite difficult to explain. It’s… a sort of perpetual repository of information, similar to the library, though much more exclusive.”

*That* definitely caught my attention, as I shifted in place. “Wait, so, like a bunch of books, scrolls, or whatever, just… hanging out in a sort of—”

“—puddle… or rather, *pool* of communication. Many liken it to a pool of information, accessed through *puddles*. Though from what I understand, most use it as a *grander system* of correspondences — a very *Nexian* invention, so it might be best to explore this at the Academy.” 

“Right…” I acknowledged, my mind *racing* at the possibility of what sounded eerily similar to a magical equivalent of the early *internet*.

“So, now that I’ve completed my end of the Nexian bargain, it’s your turn, Emma.” Thalmin urged.

“Sure. Though because of the time constraints, tonight probably won’t be where we get into the whole war history thing.”

“Yes yes yes. I don’t expect a history lesson today. Though, I do have two very *pertinent topics* to discuss.”

“Go on?”

“The first is rather straightforward.” The prince stood up, walking over to the V4c and then quickly gesturing — with both hands extended for dramatic flair — towards the welding torch. “*Why have you elected to exclude a weapon of mythical caliber from our discussions over your armaments?*” Thalmin all but yelled out, his eyes now darting back and forth between the unassuming collapsed tube and my visor.

I smiled.

Then, I outright giggled as I approached the discarded welding torch with a cocksure swagger.

“Because that’s precisely it, Thalmin. It’s *not on* my list of armaments.” I began as my sly and smug grin faced yet failed to meet the confusion growing on the prince’s face. “It’s actually part of my toolkit.”

=====

**Thalmin**

My eyes narrowed as I crossed my arms in blatant disbelief.

*Toolkit*… 

That word carried with it a facetiousness I could not overcome.

“*No*.” I enunciated bluntly. “I refuse to believe that such an artifice is anything if *not* a dedicated fire saber of some kind.”

I maintained my position, standing my ground as I stared *daggers* at the unassuming *hilt* of a *blade*. 

“I’m telling you, Thalmin. What I did was sort of a… parlor trick. A well-known but exceedingly dangerous exploit born out of both boredom and foolishness resulting in a goofy stunt that would make any supervisor, foreman, and occupational safety inspector froth at the mouth.”

“*A stunt*?” Was my immediate and gut response, my eyes twitching at the narrative Emma was still adamant on weaving. “Emma, I understand if there are secrets you wish to keep. But if you are to keep such matters confidential, then I’d rather a forthright admission of said aims.” I made my point known, crossing my arms firmly as I did so. “I demand to be spoken to with candor, rather than being led astray like a pup being regaled with tall tales of a world they are deemed too immature to comprehend.”

This seemed to finally catch the web weaver’s attention, as she walked over to the artifice and began fiddling with the buttons on its hilt with a click and a clack.

Eventually, she held it in such a fashion and at such an angle that would make any novice duelist *wince*. 

At which point did it finally dawn upon me.

*The ergonomics, the particularities of its construction, the curved head that was clearly meant to be pointed perpendicular to its hilt, this was—*

*FWOOOSHHHHH!*

A small but controlled release of flames outright confirmed my newfound realization.

As Emma was quick to mime the joining of two metal pieces, with this narrow lance of fire acting as its fuser.

I could not deny the similarities to the metalworking I’d seen done in countless smithies and the handful of manufactoriums I’d had the pleasure of visiting.

This… was undeniably just a *tool*.

Though that still raised the worrying question.

“You’ve proven your point.” I admitted with a sullen but curious breath. “But while it may be a tool, that still raises a pertinent question. Exactly *how* can such a tool be used for—”

I halted myself before I could continue, as a knowing look quickly took hold of my features.

“I think we both know the *how* of the matter better than most, Thalmin.” Emma announced with a palpable slyness, hinting at yet another universal martial trait that transcended cultures and realms. 

“Give a recruit a polearm, and you'll end up with a half-spear and a baton.” I echoed the sentiments of every pack commander in a single, universal adage.

“Mmhmm.” Came Emma’s immediate reply. “It’s no different in the skilled trades from what I hear. If anything, with the tools and toys they have at their disposal, they can get a heck of a lot more creative than a bored recruit.” She cackled. “So to directly address it, what you saw earlier was just a simple combination of safety overrides and overthrottling.”

“I see.” Was my one and only exacerbated response. “Though I must ask, this… *modification* to your welder… is it truly so simple to turn a mere smith’s tool into an enchanted blade of solid flame?” I asked, my tone poised to undermine the would-be *cadet’s* attempt at suave integrity. “Or are you simply part of the problem, *cadet*?” 

This seemed to finally, albeit momentarily, *break* the earthrealmer’s bold and cocky proclamations, as she simply froze in place, stuttering all the while. “Erm… I mean… like… when you *do* get your hands on it, it’s kinda a right of passage to just try out a *real life light-saber*, alright?”

I let out a satisfied chuckle following that. “I’ll take that as an admission to guilt, then. Though… *light-saber*. Is that really what this trick is called?”

“Yeah, well, it’s probably not translating *perfectly*. But in any case, it’s just a reference to a fictional weapon from a long-standing tale known as *Stellar Conflict*.”

“A rather *bland* name… but if this piece of fiction *did* spawn a whole host of would-be dismemberment tools all for the sake of fictional mimicry, then I must insist that you put it on our list of *sight-seer* fictions to watch, Emma.”

“Fair enough.” The earthrealmer nodded. “Memo noted. So… is there anything else you wanted to tackle tonight? You mentioned you had *two* things to ask.” 

“Indeed I did.” 

“Okay… go for it.” She urged.

“The killing blow you inflicted on the vorpal chimera.” I began. “That sound was unlike anything I’d heard from your ‘gun’. So tell me, *what did you do*?”

“Oh. That. Yeah, I think only Ilunor was present for the only other time I put the moon gun on full-auto.” Emma reasoned, prompting me to cock my head in response. “Er, sorry, that was way, way back when he was still sort of a dick. Anyways, you’ve only seen it on semi-auto during my fight with the null. That’s just one of three modes of fire my sidearm possesses.”

It didn’t take a genius to fully comprehend what the earthrealmer was purporting, as my eyes were now locked on her holstered weapon. 

Emma seemed to take note of this, drawing her weapon once more as she gestured towards a small piece of metal raised slightly above the rest of the frame. It looked to be moveable, as it tapered slightly towards three alien symbols I could not translate.

Though just from inference alone, I quickly gathered exactly what each meant. 

“Semi-auto, which you saw me using *prior* to the finale of tonight’s events.” She flicked the raised metal towards the first symbol, that of a single ‘round’. 

“Single shots.” I reasoned, garnering a nod from the earthrealmer. “Though that raises the question… why would you call it *semi*\-automatic?”

“Ah, *that*. Well. The term really just refers to the fact the cycling action — the manner in which you get the next round into the chamber — is automatic. Meaning that with each trigger pull, the action automatically reloads the next round, so you don’t have to rack the slide manually.” 

“I see.” I acknowledged with a nod, gesturing for Emma to continue.

“Next—” She flicked the raised metal upwards, towards the next symbol — three ‘rounds’ grouped in a cluster. “—is burst fire mode. I haven’t shown you this yet, but it’s simply—”

“Three shots fired in rapid succession with a single squeeze of your trigger, I’m assuming.” I interjected.

“Correct.” Emma nodded, before shifting towards the third and final symbol — three vertical bars. “Finally, there’s full-auto. Which simply means that the gun will fire continuously so long as the trigger is held.”

“And that’s the ‘mode’ you used against the vorpal chimera’s lead head?” 

“Precisely.” 

I narrowed my eyes in suspicion, leaning in closer to inspect the unassuming piece of alien artificing. “You turned its head into a *fine mist*. The sound that emerged was unlike that of a single shot, or how I’d ever imagine a continuous stream of such thunderous cracks to sound like.” I pondered out loud. “If the only variable present is the manner in which these projectiles are launched, and the projectiles and their manner of action remains the same, then the only thing that could change these sounds is—” I paused, as a startling revelation hit me like a bolt of lightning; my fur standing slightly on end. “—the speed at which these explosions happen.”

“The rate of fire, yes.” Emma acknowledged with an excitement in her voice.

“How many seconds did it take to unleash all 25 of your projectiles?” I questioned bluntly.

“Just under a second, Thalmin.” Emma responded with a fresh revival of cocky confidence.

“That… that explains a lot.” I managed out.

Though just beneath the surface, I couldn’t help but to remember the one glaring detail about this weapon that brought with it the same disturbing implications as on that fateful null fight.

*This was a sidearm.* 

***A sidearm.***

**The Next Day**

**His Eternal Majesty’s Remembrance Path | The Royal Road of Transgracia. En Route to the Township of Sips. Local Time 1100 Hours.**

**Alorant**

There was no time.

I had until noon break to unravel the mysteries of the Blue Knight.

*And I’d already overslept*.

I rushed to the front of the cart, feet scrambling against… *newly varnished wood*? 

Ignoring that, I leaped to the driver’s bench, scanning the horizon only to find the subject of both my interest and feverish dreams riding next to us.

“Blue Knight!” I bellowed out, only to be met with a resounding slap against the back of my head.

“Leave the Blue Knight alone, Alorant. She’s done enough for us as is and we’re just about to crest—”

“It’s alright. I’m more than willing to hear the kid out, Solizia.” She interjected, her strangely *rehearsed* formal cadence conflicting with the sheer casualness that she carried herself.

“Thank you, Blue Knight! Well, erm, ah—” I paused, my eyes turning to the skies and realizing that not only had noon nearly arrived… but that we’d just about crested the hill overlooking the town of Sips. “AHHH!! Well, erm, ah, okay! First question, your conveyance! The… bi-treader? Where’d you get it?”

“I built it.” Was the Blue Knight’s confident response.

I nodded, scrambling as I attempted to wrangle and arrange *coherent* followup questions.

“Erm, and your armor? I’m not sure if it’s just because of our own weak auras, but I can’t *feel* your presence. It feels like you’re just… a rock in a stream?” I stuttered out, but was once again faced with a back hand to the head.

“Where are your **manners**?! You can’t just imply the Blue Knight is—”

“A weakfielder?” The Blue Knight interjected, causing father to stammer out a string of apologies.

“Ah, erm, that was not the implication I wished to—”

“Nah, I don’t mind. If anything, I applaud your son’s observation skills, Alorant. Because yes.” The Blue Knight took the time to shift her gaze back to me. “You’re right, Alorant. My armor *is* mana resistant. Because like my bi-treader, I am… well… let’s just say where I come from? You don’t need mana for a lot of things. From conveyances all the way to fundamental things like plants, animals, and heck, even *me*.”

“Please, Blue Knight… you need not entertain my son’s foolish antics and overimagination. It is very well that we acknowledge reality as it is, yes?” Father managed out under a nervous laugh. 

And for once I *agreed*. 

“Yeah… if you’re going to make stuff up, at least make stuff up that makes sense, Blue Knight. I’m old enough to handle the truth you know. Don’t take me for a ride.”

“ALORANT! PLEASE! Mind your **manners**!” 

“Solizia, it’s alright. Alorant? How about this…  I *will* take you for a ride.”

“What?”

… 

**5 Minutes Later**

… 

“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!” I screamed at the top of my lungs, my hands holding onto the bench for dear life, as the winds up ahead slammed into my face with the force of an unrelenting gale.

I could *hear* the wheels beneath us straining, creaking, moaning, and *grinding* against the road. As every dimple and crack in our wheels was exacerbated ten fold.

Imperfections that we could overlook at *normal speeds* were now practically death sentences ready to strike us down at any given moment.

Yet in spite of this horror and the screams from both me and my father, it was the mercenary prince and the Blue Knight that seemed to find this madness *fun*.

The former, now sitting between us, kept the magical chain between the carriage and the bi-treader steady; his toothy, animalistic grin occasionally slipping into hoots, hollers, and yells as he urged for the Blue Knight to increase what was already death-defying speeds.

“FASTER!” He yelled.

And to our dread—

“YOU GOT IT!” 

—the Blue Knight obliged.

I could feel forces I never felt before pushing me up against the backrest of the bench, as I turned to father whose lips were at this point splayed open by the forces of the wind.

Our horses weren’t doing too much better, as they whinnied and whined at the back of the freshly reinforced cart, their nervous motions causing the whole undercarriage to screech at each and every opportunity.

I turned to my side, only to see the countryside passing us by so fast that I could barely make out the trees from the forest.

I then turned ahead, my eyes widening in terror as I witnessed the town of Sips barrelling towards us at unimaginable speeds.

I screamed.

=====

**Emma**

My heart raced as I felt the surge of adrenaline reaching its peak.

The blurry green of my peripheral vision soon faded into streaks of brown and yellow as the already smooth ‘royal road’ transitioned into soft pavers of Sipstown flanked by fences on either side.

Several beeps from the EVI tempered the speed demon in me, however, as I kept the speeds manageable to what the cart behind me was calculated to be rated for.

Though strangely, that wouldn’t be the *only* warning against me and Thalmin’s fun-brained schemes.

Because as we rapidly approached town, passing by the occasional cart and carriage, several unexpected interlopers craned their heads towards us in a collective display of otherworldly solidarity.

*Scarecrows*, pumpkin-heads and all, began scanning us like *traffic cameras*.

Though that was only the start of the bizarreness that came with these… things.

As they each started speaking, in synchrony and unison, at precisely fifty-meter intervals along the border of the farms.

“STOP!” One began.

“YOU’RE!” Followed by another.

“VIOLATING!” And another.

“THE LAW!” And another.

This, along with Thalmin’s own warnings following that last scarecrow, finally prompted me to slow down to a more reasonable pace. Enough for the scarecrows to suddenly *stop* their cautionary torrents.

Though that wouldn’t be the end of it. As several figures on horseback emerged from a small building half a kilometer or so up ahead.

We maintained our course until we were intercepted by said figures, each dressed in partial plate armor that seemed as decorative as it was functional if the EVI’s mana radiation warnings were of any indication. 

“Stop! You have violated the law!” One spoke, repeating the scarecrow’s warnings, though in a more *natural* cadence.

“You are charged with *speeding* in an agricultural zone without a permit or royal warrant. Pay the court a fine, or serve your sentence.” The other guardsman spoke, his eyes carefully inspecting us through his slitted helmet, as his hand maintained a steady grip on his spear.

post,I Rode the ALSO TM-B: Rivian Micromobility Startup’s First EV,2025-10-22 19:49:49,"I just spent the day in San Francisco riding a bike unlike any other I’ve ever ridden. This is it. It’s not your average looking or functioning bike—and that may not come as a surprise once you hear it’s the result of that secret skunkworks project that spun out of automaker Rivian earlier this year. ALSO, that’s the company’s name. ALSO. Also, the ALSO TM-B (as its called) costs $4,500. Yeah. But before you click away thinking this is just another absurdly priced Silicon Valley fever dream, you need to understand that this thing isn’t *really* a bike. It’s a vehicle—and that’s not some marketing mumbo-jumbo I’m being paid to say. ALSO didn't sponsor this, they have no editorial control, and no first preview rights. I’ll show you why I consider it a vehicle, but first, you need to understand that the $100B+ cycling industry is hurting with multiple large manufacturers filing for bankruptcy just this year.

Post-COVID retractions and new tariffs mean now is an awful time to launch a premium e-bike. Furthermore, the market is fractured: at the low end, you've got cheap Chinese bikes with primitive tech and zero margins. At the high end, the tech is great but prices are bonkers. DJI—the drone maker famous for undercutting everyone—just launched a bike reviewers are calling an incredible value… at *eight thousand dollars*.

And look, there's a sliver of the market buying recreational e-bikes who might stomach those prices. But most people adopting e-bikes want transportation—to replace car trips. And when your ""affordable vehicle alternative"" costs as much as a decent used Honda Civic, something's broken. The problem is mostly structural. Almost every e-bike maker is essentially an assembler buying white-labeled motors from Bosch or Bafang, batteries from Panasonic or Samsung, displays, controllers, and mechanical hardware from yet more vendors, and bolting it all together. Rad Power Bikes' entire value proposition is literally that: import everything, assemble cheap, undercut on price. Which works! But there's only so much innovation you can do with other people's parts. Everyone's bikes end up with similar capabilities, limitations, and pricing because everyone's paying the same suppliers for the same components. ALSO's solution is to stop treating e-bikes like bikes. Build a vertically integrated vehicle platform from the ground up—own the motors, batteries, electronics, software—exactly like Tesla did for electric cars. Or, ya know, like Rivian…

I’ll be honest: when I first saw the ALSO TM-B, I thought it looked ugly. There’s a step-through frame with this chunky centered abscess attached to a big downtube and seat post with wimpy looking brakes. But over two hours with it, it started to click… this isn’t styled like a bike. And I don't mean that in the pejorative ""designed by committee"" way—I mean it's clearly designed with manufacturing and functionality as the primary constraints, with aesthetics as a distant third.

There’s a chunky, structural, magnesium heart that houses almost everything: the motor mounts to it. The battery latches into it. The rear suspension pivots on it. The seat mates with it. And it utilizes ""zonal architecture""—a term borrowed from automotive where instead of having electronics scattered all over the vehicle, you consolidate compute and power distribution into zones. For a bike, it means no cassette nor derailleur, no seat stay, no motor bolted to a frame that was designed before anyone knew a motor was going in. Everything crucial lives in this central hub. It's utilitarian in a way that saves cost and simplifies assembly, and honestly? I came around on it. There's something refreshingly honest about a design that says, ""Here's where all the important stuff is, and we're not going to hide it."" Form following function in a way that feels considered, not lazy.

That utilitarian, function-first philosophy extends way beyond the physical design—it's baked into the software stack too, and the first place you notice that is the display. They call it the ""Portal,"" which is a bit dramatic, but whatever. It's a bright, high-contrast LCD mounted in the center of the handlebars that's easily visible even in direct sunlight. But the screen itself isn't the interesting part—it's what's running underneath: a real-time OS built from scratch, close to the metal, which means it's responsive and powerful in a way that e-bike displays just aren't. During the demo, I pulled the battery out to examine it—turn the handle, pull straight out, and you've got a 500 or 800 watt-hour pack depending on trim level. It's got 240-watt USB-C PD 3.1 bidirectional ports that can charge the battery itself or power anything else you plug into it, plus a little e-ink display shows state of charge. Anyways, when I slammed it back in, the display fired up instantly. No boot logo. No loading screen. Just on. Chris, the CEO, lit up when I pointed this out—apparently I was the first person in their demo cycle to notice. But it's a small example of what can be done when you have full control of everything: from pedal cadence, to assist curves, to brake feel. It also means they can push over-the-air updates to continuously improve the bike rather than leave it frozen in time. More importantly, the connectivity enables smartphone integration at a level that simply doesn't exist in the e-bike world—the kind of seamless experience you'd only find in the best electric cars.

It utilizes your phone as a key. Walk up to the bike, it wakes up, knows its you, and loads your settings. You hop on and go. Walk away, it locks. The motor physically immobilizes the rear wheel, the pedals decouple, the battery latches electronically. Motion sensors send you a push notification if someone tampers with it and a very loud alarm sounds to deter theft. If someone does actually manage to steal it, you can track it via GPS and remotely disable the entire bike. And while there’s also the potential for ALSO to use this for evil, every component is also serialized and bound to your bike unless you unbind it, eliminating the resale value for stolen parts.

This set of features addresses the worst part of bike ownership in the US: where do I park this thing and will it still be there when I get back? This eliminates the need for bike racks. No carrying a u-lock. Just park it and walk away. Like a vehicle. It’s frictionless.

Beyond security, there’s turn-by-turn navigation designed for cycling that actually accounts for your assist level, average speed, state of charge, and elevation. So you get accurate ETAs and arrival state of charge—critical if you’re using this as…. a vehicle. There’s media integration too. Whatever’s playing on your phone shows up on the display, you can control volume and seeking with the handlebar buttons. Incoming calls also pop up on the display asking if you want to accept or decline. These aren’t bike features. They’re vehicle features. And that distinction is what ALSO is betting on—that people (especially here in the US) will stop thinking: “I’m going to go for a bike ride” and start thinking: “I’m going to take my ALSO to get groceries at the farmers market.” Which we did, by the way, without having to park a car 5 blocks away—we just rode our vehicles straight through. It’s a paradigm shift, and I started to “get it.”

ALSO claims this multi-use functionality is enabled by their modular frame system. The pitch is simple: instead of buying multiple bikes for different purposes, you buy one TM-B and swap the top frame depending on what you're doing. There's a ""Solo"" frame for recreation, a ""Utility"" frame with a rear rack for hauling cargo or kids, and a ""Comfort"" frame with an upright seating position for people who don't identify as cyclists. You go into the settings menu, hit ""swap frame,"" wait a couple seconds for the electric latch to release, lift off the old frame, pop on the new one, and it auto-detects everything—powering the integrated lights and adjusting the vehicle's ride settings based on expected load.

It's cool! Genuinely cool! And I can kinda see one legitimate use case: having two utility racks—one set up with a toddler seat for taking my kid to school, another configured with bins for grocery runs. But beyond that? I'm skeptical. How often is someone actually going to swap these? Does the rear rack suddenly become a burden when I want to ride up the canyon? I doubt it. I mean, it's an 80-pound e-bike. Really, the modularity aspect is most useful when multiple people in the home want to ride the same bike. You each have your own seat with your preferences paired to it and it's an easy swap. But that's also only necessary because there's no quick seat-post adjustment like most bikes have. You need to use an allen key. Now, ALSO wisely decided that most third-party bike accessories were already great and they didn't need to make many proprietary ones—though they will be selling a phone holster and bins that are the exact same size as a paper grocery bag, which is clever. Being compatible with stuff that already exists is great! But it also means accepting different mounting systems that are typically rather permanent once installed. Even ALSO's own custom front rack isn't that easily removable—you pressure clamp it onto the fork upper and it stays there. It feels like they started with this ambitious modular concept and then kind of gave up after the seat. Which, fine. Maybe modularity for modularity's sake isn't the point. But it does make me wonder if the complexity and cost of the electric latch system and serialized frames is justified when, in practice, most people will probably install one configuration and leave it there forever.

That said, despite being and looking the way that it does, the bike handles shockingly well. It's agile at low speeds and easy to maneuver in tight spaces (not typical of 80 pound e-bikes), but it's also stable at high speeds. I hit 31 miles per hour multiple times and it never felt twitchy or nervous. Part of that is geometry. They tuned head tube angle and trail to balance maneuverability with stability. Part of that is weight distribution. That magnesium heart puts the battery and motor low and central. More so than any e-bike on the market. But it's mostly suspension. Both the front and rear have a shocking amount of travel and the inverted front fork has enough adjustability that you can dial in a comfortable setup to absorb road bumps without it feeling sloppy or tighten it up when you need more feedback. Chris actually told me to intentionally hit a pothole to test it. So I did. And then a manhole cover. The bike soaked up both impacts without complaint—no harsh jarring, no loss of control—but it never felt slow or unresponsive either. Given that the retail price of this almost certainly white-labeled FOX fork is $2 grand alone, perhaps I should be unsurprised it was so good.

But the real party trick is the propulsion system they call Dream Ride. This bike is completely pedal-by-wire—the first of its kind. There's no mechanical connection between the pedals and the rear wheel. You pedal into a generator that converts your input to electrical energy, which the bike either sends to the motor or, if you’re generating more than it needs to output, into the battery. And that motor? It’s massive. ALSO built it in-house using a bar-wound stator—and extremely high-end technique you’d mostly only see in the best electric cars. Which, given where this comes from, makes sense. But it’s overkill for a bike in the best possible way. It’s also the first e-bike with real regenerative braking. While you can coast like a normal bike, as soon as you start to pull the brakes, energy is captured by your deceleration, run through inverters, and put back into the battery. And just like in a Rivian, the regen is *really* good. The bike can regen all the way down to a complete stop, and unless you’re biting into the handbrakes with a really aggressive braking event, you don’t use the friction brakes at all—which explains why the disk brakes appear to be a little undersized—because you basically never use them.

Upfront, you’ll also see something quite unusual: while most e-bikes have a wheel speed sensor that measures how often the front wheel finishes a complete rotation, the ALSO has a grid-type speed sensor that measures more than 60 times per revolution—more than any other bike on the market. The rear doesn’t even have one of these sensors—also unheard of—but that’s because it uses the much more accurate real-time input/output at the drive motor—which is possible because the belt is always spinning, which is possible because the pedals aren’t connected to the drivetrain at all. Not only does this allow them to implement a pseudo regen-controlled ABS system, but it also makes for the smoothest accelerating, gentlest braking, and most responsive e-bike I’ve ever used. It’s like the first time I drove an EV. Incredibly smooth, but also weird.

And this bike feels *weird*.

Because in the default automatic mode, there is no gearing because the bike literally doesn’t have gears. It's like an electric car. Now, there are “assist levels”—standard e-bike vernacular—but they're not really ""assisting"" you. Because you cannot move this bike without the bike moving itself. Remember, there is no physical connection to the rear wheel! At assist level one, the lowest setting, you top out at about 10 to 11 miles per hour. At assist level ten, you max out at the Class 3 speed limit of 28 mph. Maybe 30 if you're going downhill before the limiter kicks in. But here's the bizarre part: no matter what assist level you're in, the pedaling resistance feels the same. It's one long, predictable, consistent ""gear."" You go up a hill and there's zero resistance increase on the pedals. You go downhill and you pedal at the same speed with the same resistance. It's truly bizarre. Not in a bad way, but absolutely an adjustment. It feels like a vehicle, not like a bicycle.

Now, if you don't want that, there's a manual mode on all but the base-trim with 10 fixed ratios that you can shift through with the same handlebar buttons. Start peddling from a stop in 8th gear and there’s a ton of resistance—just like there would be in a high gear on a real bike—but it’s an artificial sensation created by resistance from the pedal stator. The best way to explain it is to just show you: \[see attached video\]

So yeah, the torque is absurd. It’s rated at 180 Newton-meters at the wheel—more than double what most e-bikes push. In max assist mode, if you stomp the pedals from a stop, the front wheel actually lifts. It’s like: “Oh, you want to go?” Chris told me one of their core safety goals was for the bike to out-accelerate a car at an intersection—specifically hitting 0.3 Gs, which is right at the line between normal and aggressive driving. And yeah, they nailed it. I took this thing up a legitimately steep Palo Alto hill—the kind where you’d normally downshift on a regular bike and resign yourself to a slow grind. While the motor was audibly working, hard, the bike held its maximum speed the entire way up. No slowdown. Just relentless forward motion. And the thing genuinely keeps up with traffic, which is kind of the point if you’re trying to use it for real transportation. The idea is that by accelerating like a vehicle—rather than like a bike—you’re less likely to get cut off or misjudged by drivers who expect cyclists to be slow and in the way. But there’s a trade-off: the more the bike behaves like a motorcycle, the more rider skill matters, and the more serious things get if something goes wrong. Speed can help you escape danger—but it can also amplify it.

Now, about regulations: the TM-B cleverly meets multiple e-bike classifications depending on mode. In off-road mode, it's limited to 20 mph and the throttle is disabled, making it a Class 1 bike—though there's a clever workaround where you can press the throttle while pedaling to get a slight boost because it creates artificial “half-gears.” In road mode, the throttle works up to 20 mph (Class 2) but pedal assist takes you to 28 mph (Class 3). It’s truly a class e-bike of all time.

Obviously, the more aggressively you ride, the more power you consume. And if you misjudge range, you're walking home or calling an Uber because remember, you cannot pedal unassisted—the pedals are just a video game controller. While the bike's 500 or 800 watt-hour battery seems to be on the small side, much of that energy is recaptured through regeneration. ALSO claims you'll get anywhere from 60 to 100 miles based on battery size and how you ride, which should cover most use cases.

Riding this bike was an absolute blast—the most fun I've had on any e-bike ever. But at the end of my two-hour ride, I was left with an uncomfortable question: who is this for?

You see, there will be three trims. A limited Launch Edition and a Performance trim—with the same capabilities, both at $4,500. Then, a base model will follow with the smaller battery, cheaper fork, automatic-only modes, and a price in the $3,000s. But even at those prices, the TM-B sits in no-man's-land. It's way more expensive than cheap Chinese e-bikes that still get you from A to B. But it's also not specialized enough to win over serious mountain bikers dropping $8,000+ on their rigs. Those buyers want proven trail capability, and the TM-B—despite its all-terrain package—isn't that bike. This is a high-performance urban vehicle that *can handle* gravel.

ALSO is betting there's a market in between. People who want quality transportation and will pay for features that genuinely make it better than a car for short trips. People who care about integrated software and phone-as-a-key. People in cities where parking is impossible and traffic is miserable. Maybe that market exists in San Francisco, Portland, Amsterdam, or Paris. In most of America? I'm less convinced.

But ALSO's real play seems to be commercial. They showed a number of four-wheeled cargo quad prototypes to replace golf carts and smaller vans for last-mile delivery, which are becoming increasingly desired in cities like New York, where they're permitted in bike lanes. And that's where all this vertical integration pays off. When you've already built all the hardware and own the software, adapting it to new form factors is trivial. Especially in a largely unregulated market such as this one—no crash or safety tests and years long certifications required. That's where they might actually have something.

The TM-B is unlike anything else out there. It made me rethink what a bicycle is and should be used for. So who's it for? Definitely not everybody. But it's for me. I've wanted to ride it again every single day since that demo, so I put down a deposit—not for the Launch Edition because I'm not into that colorway, but I'm getting one. Whether ALSO succeeds or fades into obscurity doesn't really matter. Someone needed to take this swing, and I'm glad it's them.

post,LA Showed Us How to Keep Walmarts Out,2025-08-26 01:43:13,"Shoutout to Los Angeles for actually thinking about communities and keeping Walmart supercenters out. Traffic, massive lots, low-wage jobs — they said “no thanks,” and our neighborhoods are better for it.

Over in r/ Orange County, the conversation’s been messy. Some pushback, some haters… and lately it feels like big corporations are lurking on Reddit, trying to shape our cities and fight change. They’re using these platforms to take away our power to decide what our communities should look like.

LA shows it can be done. Let’s take notes: smarter zoning, smarter planning, and communities that come first, not giant parking lots.

Edit: I’m also thinking about replacing Walmarts with affordable housing like apartments or condos to help with the housing crisis and even impact the price of goods in the community.

Edit edit: Someone mentioned Costco’s new Baldwin Hills project, where they’re putting apartments on top of the store. That’s actually a great example of smarter land use. ",317,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/1n06ifb/la_showed_us_how_to_keep_walmarts_out/,low-traffic zones,

post,"How bad is Stuart Skinner, really?",2025-04-24 17:42:00,"There’s been a lot of talk about contradictory talk about how much Skinner vs. the Oilers skaters in front of him are responsible for Edmonton being down 0-2 against LA, so I decided to review the tape/ stats to determine where accountability lies.

A) Goals Saved Above/ Below Expected

In 2 games, Skinner has conceded 11 goals on 58 shots, which works out to a save percentage of 81.0% (not great Bob). That’s the fourth lowest save % of the 17 goalies who’ve seen action in the playoffs to this point. However, if we increase the minimum # of shots faced to 20 (which excludes Pickard, who has a SV% of 66.67% on 3 shots, and Vasilevsky, who has a SV% of 62.5% on 16 shots), then Skinner is the second worst (just ahead of Linus Ullmark, who has a SV% of 80%).

That being said, Money Puck has Skinner as – comfortably – the worst goalie in the playoffs with respect to goals saved above expected. Skinner’s xGA is 6.32, so the 11 he has conceded puts him at -4.7. Ullmark – who has conceded 9 goals – has an xGA of 5.6, which puts him at a -3.4.

For reference, of the 103 goalies who saw time in the regular season (irrespective of games started), Money Puck ranked Skinner 65th based on Goals Saved Above Expected (-1.5). If you increase the minimum threshold to 10 starts, Skinner ranks 47th out of 73, which is a bit more to the middle of the pack. However, this still accounts for a lot of backups; Skinner started 51 games, which puts him firmly in the 1A starter territory. If we increase the threshold of minimum games to played, Skinner’s stats start to drop to the end of the list more quickly:

- 20 games played: 41st of 61
- 30 games played: 33rd of 45
- 40 games played: 24th of 30
- 50 games played: 18th of 22

When we look at the threshold of elite goalies (i.e., more than 50 starts), Skinner is one of five goalies (including Saros and Swayman) who have a negative goals saved above expected.So, what is Skinner doing so poorly in the playoffs?

B) Shots Faced

One of the things we hear a lot is that the Oilers give up a lot of high-quality chances. So, let’s look at the volume of shots faced and their quality. Again, I’m looking at Money Puck.

Skinner has faced 58 shots on net through 2 games. That’s objectively a lot. If we extrapolate out to shots faced/ 60 minutes played, Skinner has faced 32.2 shots/60. That’s the second highest total in the playoffs behind Markstrom, who has faced a staggering 35.8 shots/60 (Markstrom meanwhile has a 92.9 SV% and a GSAE of +3.9, light a candle for this guy). Indeed, none of the other 15 goalies in the playoffs has a shots/60 of &gt;30 (the next highest is Stolarz, who has a 29.8 shots/60, with a 93.4 SV% and a GSAE of +0.37). So, Skinner faces a lot of shots. For comparison, the guy he’s facing (Kuemper), is facing 25.5 shots/60, with a GSAE of -1.49.

Money Puck breaks down save% of low, medium, and high danger shots. What’re Skinner’s ranks?

- Low Danger: 94.5%, 14th out of 17 goalies (-2.3% relative to expected)
- Medium Danger: 76.0%, 16th out of 17 goalies (-11.1% relative to expected)
- High Danger: 60.0%, 11th out of 16 goalies, excluding Pickard who hasn’t faced a high danger unblocked chance (-12.4% relative to expected)

It’s interesting that Skinner is not doing well on high danger chances but is really bad on low and medium danger shots. Money Puck doesn’t have a ‘clutchness’ statistic, but you could reasonably say that a goalie who makes saves on dangerous shots but doesn’t on relatively easy shots isn’t clutch. That jives with what we’ve seen of Skinner this year, especially on the GWG in Game 1.

The Oilers have blocked ~20% of all shots faced by their goalies in the playoffs (20% for Pickard, and 19.42% for Skinner). That ranks 11th and 12th respectively for all goalies in the playoffs. Skinner has faced the highest % of unblocked shot attempts on goal, sitting at 51.79% (a shade ahead of Montembeault, who has 51.64% of unblocked shot attempts on goal). It indicates that the Oilers’ defensive structure is designed to give Skinner clean looks while taking away passing lanes (which we’ll discuss below). Skinner has a SV% of 90.2% on unblocked shot attempts, which is 15th out of 17 goalies who’ve seen time in the playoffs. Again, not great, Bob.

C) Freezes/ Rebounds

Skinner is really good at not allowing rebounds, with 0.05 rebounds/ save (5th of 17). Also, he doesn’t consistently freeze pucks, coming in with 0.119 freezes/ save (13th of 17). This is consistent with what we hypothesized above, i.e., the Oilers D prioritizing clean looks to limit rebounds, and allowing him to get the puck back in play quickly.

D) Tape – Game 1

- Goal 1: Can’t blame Skinner. Nice cycle play by LA in the zone leading to Kuzmenko sneaking out from behind the net unmarked for a backdoor tap-in. Skinner was square to the shooter with three D men boxing out. The D drifted towards the shooter in the dot (not necessary IMO), and 44 missed Kuzmenko coming to the net and failed to take away the cross-crease pass.

- Goal 2: I blame Skinner. He had a clear view of Doughty who was high in the face off circle. Doughty snaps a high shot stick side that Skinner shouldered away without control (despite me saying above he has good rebound control numbers). Puck goes to Byfield who catches it, settles it, and banks it in off Skinner’s back. Skinner shows poor mobility and puck tracking, as he’s caught looking for the puck without knowing where he rebounded it, and doesn’t seal back to the net quickly.

- Goal 3: Can’t blame Skinner. Kempe outpowers Bouchard to snap off a high danger chance right in front. Good stop, Kopitar picks up the rebound and is followed by THREE Oilers. He still cycles the puck around and a fourth Oiler (Nurse) is below the goal line and fails to get the puck which comes out to an unmarked Kempe in front. Kempe dekes Skinner who’s already swimming, and tucks it in.

- Goal 4: Hard to blame Skinner. Oilers D has a really bad behind the net cycle, and basically just pokes the puck out in front of the net where the shooter snaps it past Skinner. Skinner was square to the shooter and had a clean look, but he sits back in his net, making himself small. This is something that happens a LOT with Skinner, who doesn’t use his body and size to cut down shooting lanes. Still, hard to lay blame on him as he wasn’t expecting the terrible puck from behind the net.

- Goal 5: I blame Skinner. Off the face off, the puck is cycled back to the first D Man, who advances to the top of the circle. Skinner tracks him, but is totally unprepared for the pass cross-ice to Fiala who’s at the top of the opposite circle. Fiala wastes no time and rips it, and Skinner’s not in position to make the stop. There was traffic in front obscuring his vision, but you’d expect him to see that.

- Goal 6: I blame Skinner. He has a clean view of the shooter, but is drifting left to follow Foegele, who’s setting a screen. Danault waffles a muffin past Skinner to his right, who clearly doesn’t see the puck at all. You can see him still searching for it as it goes past.

Blame Skinner on 3/6 goals. Tentative play, bad puck tracking/ rebound control, poor lateral movement. You see him start to correct for tentative play in Game 2, but he doesn’t go far enough (see below).

E) Tape – Game 2

- Goal 1: Can’t blame Skinner. 3 on 3 rush, 96 pushes Foegele to the outside but doesn’t keep up w/ him, opening a lane. Oiler D# 25 gets down to take away the cross crease, so Skinner stays square to Foegele. LA# 24 stays high, so he’s not a threat, but Clarke blows by his man on the back end and crashes to the net. Foegele gives a great pass and Clarke tucks it home.

- Goal 2: I blame Skinner (but there’s plenty to go around). Oilers D delivers a big hit on the boards, but then deactivates, allowing Byfield to get the puck on the half wall. The only remaining Oilers D elects to hold his ice and sags back to take away the cross-ice pass, giving Skinner the shooter. Byfield walks in and Skinner backs away, becoming smaller, allowing Byfield to tuck it past him. Giving the goalie responsibility for a lone skater is a pretty standard tactic in and odd man situation, and Skinner could have played this better. That he was in the position sucks, but you expect the goalie to make a better play here.

- Goal 3: Hard to blame Skinner. Powerplay cycle going well, there’s a shot from the blueline which he never saw, which rebounds off the board to Kuzmenko, who tucks it behind Skinner (who has wandered out of his net). I’ve given Skinner grief for staying back, but here he could’ve. He stays tight to his posts as the puck cycles behind the net but drifts out to try and see the puck as it goes to the blueline. This goes back to his slow puck tracking, but I’m not giving him full blame for this goal.

- Goal 4: I blame Skinner (but plenty to go around). Brutal turnover in their zone again, the puck dribbles out to Kempe who takes it at the top of the circle, takes a few steps and rips it past Skinner stick side. Skinner is square to the shooter and comes out to meet him but stops. Kempe literally waits until Skinner stops moving before loading up and firing it far side from just below the dot.

- Goal 5: I don’t blame Skinner. Kopitar scores on the back door from Fiala. Skinner is square to Fiala and is off his post to cut down the angle (good!), but there’s traffic in the crease and he’s unable to get back to get to the shooter once the pass goes cross-ice. You need the D to make the block there.

I blame Skinner on 2/5 goals in Game 2, and for 5 of the 11 he has given up over two games, which matches with Money Puck’s -4.7 saved above expected. 

Conclusion

Skinner’s not doing super well, but the Oilers D is also playing poorly. Skinner’s puck tracking? Not great. Doesn’t use his frame to cut down angles, and plays really tentatively. His lateral and backwards movement (which you can see in other plays that don’t result in goals) is also weak. I haven’t played goalie in any level above beer league, so take what I say with huge chunks of salt, but you can SEE him trying to figure out what to do in real-time, instead of read-reacting. I don’t know if this is a vision thing, an IQ thing, or a quick twitch thing, but it’s not something that can be easily resolved over the course of a playoff run or a single series. This seems to be who he is.

I don’t think the Oilers are cooked since they have the best two players on the ice, but those guys can’t play 60 minutes. We also saw the Oilers look like total dog water at several points last year, but they still came within 1 goal in Game 7 of the finals. But if they want to win, Skinner cannot be starting for them next year.   ",590,https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1k6vemf/how_bad_is_stuart_skinner_really/,low-traffic zones,

**Brother (38M) wants me (33F) to go out of my comfort zone on behalf of his bestie.**

I'm 33F and a while back I started walking again. I used to be pretty active, but I didn't adjust well to the stress of the last few years. My mental health got progressively worse and the idea of going out during the day was hard for for me, so I stopped doing a lot of things and basically became a hermit.

Walking or hiking meant sharing space with more people and noise, fully existing and facing myself, my now ill fitting clothes, others. I finally picked myself up somewhat and started doing it at daybreak. Not so early it's too dark and dangerous, but a little before morning routines are in full swing. 

There is this one state park nearby that is small and secluded enough to offer privacy, has enough natural terrain for ""lite-hike"" experience, but also gets plenty foot traffic and security to be safe in the wee hours. It's mostly retirees or committed athletes that early, which is fantastic, cause they stick mostly to the track - as opposed to the odd trails and meandering slopes I favour. Besides, the former are super welcoming and the latter too focused on their own routines to care.

Couple months back I get there slightly earlier than usual and, after waving hi to the rangers at the parking lot, I'm off. I was vaguely aware of someone behind me, but didn't give it much thought at first. Until I realised they were matching paces with me and taking all the weird turns I usually do because I prefer to walk randomly rather than actually exercising.

It's dark and foggy and hearing footsteps behind me has me on edge, so I lean down to ""tie"" my shoes and wait for whomever it is to pass. They stop several paces away and wait for me to get going. The second I do, they do too. All I can see without fully turning is a bulky shape in a hoodie.

I pick up the pace to get back on the main track and they match it. I'm low-key freaking out, but still. Maybe they were following the only other person because they didn't know all the paths and were too awkward to ask or just wander? Then, at this one point, beneath a bridge of sorts, where you have to cross a copse of trees before breaking into the gravel path, and it's a somewhat lengthy blind spot with no side exits, they start running. My heart was in my mouth and I just shot off.

I stumbled into the track right in front an elderly couple I was familiar with and whoever it wast behind me skidded into an abrupt halt as the couple waved at me. They just as harshly looped back to the footpath. I will be the first to admit I was maybe too high strung at the time, but that they immediately backtracked once we were around people told me this wasn't just my anxiety.

I was pretty shaky, but decided to keep going, sticking to the main path, finish a full loop of the park and go home. Thing is, the second the elderly couple waved bye and veered off into the secondary parking and I was alone again, this dude comes out of the nearby foliage. It's clearly a guy, much closer, and he's walking quickly and shooting glances to every direction while veering straight towards me.

I pretend to be about to take a turn into another footpath and watch as he makes for the same one, paces behind. So I stick to the well lit main track, try not to sprint, make a show of ""making a phone call"" (even tho there's spotty service there and I had no bars) and head for this cleaning crew station I know is right around the bend.

I ran straight in and very shakily tried to explain everything and ask if I can stay there a bit. I've befriended half the park staff at this point and they immediately called security. I'm pretty much shaking and holding back tears at this point and we all watch as the dude almost comes in after me, realizes where he is, books it out and gets stopped by a ranger a few meters off.

An argument ensued and he was, from my understanding, ""strongly encouraged to leave and they would like to watch him do it"".  I recounted this to my family that same morning. A couple days later my brother (38m) approached me to say the dude I got banned (? not even sure he did?) from the park is the BIL of one of his bffs who told a sob story about trying to make sure a girl was safe out and was accused of being a predator for his troubles.

My brother's friend has been pressuring him to get me in touch with the dude to apologise, because now he can't go to his favourite spot and it was all a ""misunderstanding"". I said no, I won't, he wouldn't have been kicked out if he wasn't belligerent to security and I still do not believe for one second he isn't a huge creep. 

They gave up after a while. That is, until a couple weeks ago. Now my brother's friend is going through an incredibly hard time (bereaved, disease, financial woes) and my bro's started pressuring me again because he feels it would be a kindness to his actual friend and I can just go back to ignoring the creep after. I bloody refuse.

They keep telling me the guy didn't do anything except have bad timing and maybe I am being too sensitive and who knows if my perception aligns with how things went down and regardless it would be for brother's friend, not the dude...

I am about this close to sever ties with my brother I love. I understand he's also been going through a weird time emotionally and it's got worse with his bff's current circumstances, but I don't know what I can say beyond ""back the fuck off"". How can I explain to my brother how inappropriate he's being? I want my brother to leave me alone, impress how much he's crossed a line and also offer an alternative to support him.

TL;DR Brother (38M) thinks I'm (33F) exaggerating being followed and wants me to apologise to dude who did it because it's his best friend's BIL.

**Brother (38M) insists I (33F) apologise to appease his bestie**

I'll make it short and sweet: a few months back I (33F) was very clearly followed during a walk in a way that made me feel unsafe. The ""stalker"" turned out to be brother's (38M) best friend's BIl.

My brother's bestie is going through a genuinely rough time right now. His BIL is pressuring him and, as a result, my brother wants me to get in touch with the dude and apologise to ""keep the peace"".

I refuse and it's putting a strain on our relationship and brother's been getting pushier. I don't know how to properly impress on my brother I trust my impression of events and I would feel unsafe getting in touch with the guy.

He has a million excuses why I should or could and I'm considering going LC. Is there anything I can say that will make him see how inappropriate this ask is? Is there another way I can support him in lieu of doing this?

TL;DR Brother wants to appease his bestie by throwing me under the bus and making me apologise for being followed.

**UPDATE Brother (38m) insist I (33f) apologise to appease his bestie**

Hey there, everyone. I wanted to post this since I got a lot more support in my [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/y9b6u9/brother_38m_insists_i_33f_apologise_to_appease/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) than I initially imagined I would. For those who did not see it: basically I was lowkey stalked by a random dude in a park and it was really stressful. As it turned out, he was my brother's best friend's BIL (I know that's a mouthful). Brother's bestie was going through something, so they decided to pressure me to apologise to the creep. 


To make the update easier to follow, I'm giving everyone fake names:

My brother: Frodo
Brother's bestie: Sam
Bestie's wife: Bunny
BIL: Joe


When I posted, I was thinking more in the line of getting scripts to help handle the convo with Frodo about how he was crossing boundaries and making him understand how much he hurt me in doing so. I genuinely felt unsafe in the original situation and he was basically sweeping it under the rug to avoid extra drama for himself/Sam. Thing is, I had no hand in that drama, as many of you pointed out. No scripts were given, just a lot of very valid ""why are you underreacting to this"".


So, Joe got a hold of my social media and started messaging me. It was many flavours of fucked up. This didn't last a full day before I went to the police to file an official report and they basically went ""are you sure you didn't lead him on"". Yeah. Still, I told everyone and their mother (literally, lol) I had gone to the police about it, because I figured they didn't need the specifics, just the threat of action.


I was psyching myself up to confront my brother when he dropped the messages and actually called me. He said Sam and Bunny had finally gotten on the same page. It turns out she was jealous of me?! I am an unattractive, awkward person who has known Sam like a brother my whole life... A brother I don't quite see eye to eye with and don't feel any need to be close to... Basically, I put up with this dude for my actual brother. If I had a choice, they wouldn't be bffs to begin with. So there was zero reason for jealousy. We see each other maybe twice a year, in group hangs.


Anyways, Bunny reveals that, while she didn't put her brother Joe up to the original creeping, once she put the dots together, she basically handed him my info and said ""go nuts"". This caused a certain friction between her and Sam because, as much as I may dislike some of his worldviews, he is fundamentally decent. 


So Frodo called to apologise and say he realized there were strings being pulled behind the curtains... And I felt so very disappointed. I realised he wasn't on my side to begin with and it made me look back at several of our latest interactions where he sort of discounted my own lived experience and said he'll support me once those impressions are proven to be accurate and not just me being overly sensitive. 


I've gone LC with my brother and his drama llamas and what guts me most is he hasn't even noticed it yet and I'm not sure he will. 


I also went digging on Joe, since a lot of you pointed out this might not be his first time making women feel unsafe. He's been divorced three times and has had domestic violence charges brought up and dropped. I couldn't find much more without stirring the pot, but I'm keeping an eye on it. I also filed an online police report, since in person cops sucked, just so there's a paper trail. 


All in all, I think I needed both the validation and the tough love and criticism this sub gave me, so thank you. Aspiring to never have reason to post again, though!


TL;DR was right to think creep was creeping have gone low contact with my brother.

I can almost guarantee that the security guards didn't immediately leap to accusing him of anything. They went out to get his version of what was going on. He immediately became confrontational with them, so they banned him from the park.

In a surprising turn of events, Thacea stepped up to the plate almost immediately, turning to the rest of the group with a look of resolve on her face that might’ve actually betrayed a genuine *hint* of excitement. “I volunteer to be the next on this roster.” The avinor’s speaking mannerisms remained largely the same - polite and reserved. Yet similar to her features, she seemed to allow a small sliver of genuine excitement to color her voice as she stood up at about the same time Thalmin began packing away his projector.

This gave me and the two guys some room for smalltalk.

“So, what did you think?” Thalmin began with an expectant grin.

“About your realm?” Ilunor replied almost immediately.

“Yes, Vunerian, what else is there that I could have alluded to?”

“Well, I’ve said my piece.” Ilunor responded with a shrug. “An average run-of-the-mill adjacent realm, perhaps even less than average if I were to delve into any critical analysis of what was shown.” 

Thalmin let out a growl at this, which prompted me to add my two cents in before the two could get into another verbal spat.

“Well I thought your realm was very impressive, Thalmin.” I spoke earnestly, and with a hint of giddiness, as the realization of having just been thrust into a *second* fantasy realm was really starting to sink in now. “From the walls, to the buildings, and even the streets, everything was just like being transported back in time.” I spoke with a palpable wanderlust in my voice.

Thalmin’s smile grew for the first half of that, but a questioning glare began forming just as quickly at the latter statement. “Back in time?”

“Oh, sorry, it’s just, we had similar architectural and city-planning methods as you before things started erm…” 

*Industrializing?*

“... changing.” I decided on a vaguer descriptor instead. “But erm, yeah! Speaking frankly, it’s impressive to see your infrastructure projects, what with the roads, public spaces like the bathhouse, an actual sewage system, and then some! It’s honestly rather impressive!”

“Heh. The newrealmer is impressed by the unseen underbelly of civilization it seems?” Ilunor interjected snidely.

“Well, it’s more like I have an appreciation for what actually makes a city, and a civilization *tick*, Ilunor.” I snapped back just as quickly at his cheap quips. “Not everything is about the most impressive castle or the fanciest of monuments. It’s these more subtle aspects of civilization that truly shows the development of a nation.” 

This seemed to genuinely baffle the Vunerian, as he cocked his head in confusion, as if being faced with an utterly foreign concept.

“Public works are not the measure with which I would base my analyses on the impressiveness of a civilization, Booker.” He stated plainly, frankly, and in no uncertain terms. “It may come third or fourth in my consideration of that title, but it should be more of an afterthought than a primary aspect of consideration.” He eventually shrugged, after parsing the thought in his mind for a few moments. “But what can I expect from the mentality of a *commoner*. You see the mundane as the grand, and the grand as the mundane… or perhaps the grand is simply too far above you to consider at all.” 

I was just about to put in a few choice words in response to that before Thacea suddenly returned with her sight-seer already almost fully assembled.

“I do hope I’m not interrupting anything?” Thacea addressed all three of us with a questioning gaze.

“No, not at all.” Ilunor replied promptly, which prompted me to just sigh in response, before shrugging. 

“Nothing of value was spoken, and nothing of value was lost as a result.” I chimed in with a side-eye directed towards the Vunerian.

Thacea, upon reading the room, decided to continue unabated. 

“Before I commence my sight-seer experience, I would like to note that this particular chapter of my sight-seer was modified to be more of a *visual* experience, as opposed to Thalmin’s more narrative-driven piece. I must also warn you, that you may experience motion sickness and its accompanying maladies such as dizziness, nausea, and the sort.”

“And you assume this because you believe all of us to have *never* experienced flight before?” Ilunor abruptly interjected, prompting the avinor princess to nod once in reply.

“That is correct, however I did not mean any offense by-”

“Of course you didn’t.” He continued with that same, cocky, shit-eating grin as if excited to explain just exactly *how* Thacea was in the wrong here. “And I take no offense, of course. For you are correct in assuming that *most* land dwellers are, of course, *bound* by their physical limitations. However… the fact of the matter is, *I* am not *like* **most** land-dwellers, Thacea Dilani. For *I* am a Vunerian of the house of Rularia. As such, you must keep in mind both my draconic heritage, and my personal privileges. The former granting me immunity to the maladies commonly found from a land-dweller experiencing that which was not meant for them - flight. The latter being my inherent experience in riding *drakes*, for my family owns both the leisurely and *combat* varietals.” 

Thacea took all of this with stride, simply nodding once at the Vunerian’s long winded explanation, managing to pull the wind out of his sails through what was effectively a simple acknowledgement to a grandiose display of verbiage.

I, however, couldn’t help but to let out a long sigh, as I first turned towards the EVI to add a small note to my list of growing ideas.

“EVI?”  


**“Yes, Cadet Booker?”**

“Make sure we include a few intra-atmo aircraft in the demo, maybe somewhere in the background while we show off the city.” 

**“Affirmative, Cadet Booker.”** 

Once that was done, I quickly turned towards Ilunor with a cock of my head, all the while directing my speech to Thacea. “No offense taken here as well, Thacea. For I too have had my fair share of experiences in flight. Both civilian and military, in aircraft and in power armor.” I spoke in no uncertain terms, prompting the Vunerian to glare at me with a look of someone who’d just been challenged by a perceived *lesser* opponent.

“It is one thing to create flying *artifices*, Booker. That much I can see through your use of *drones*. It is, however, another thing entirely to create what you claim are *aerial-borne vessels*.” 

“Listen, Ilunor. How about we settle this with me just *showing* it to you when we get to my presentation” I answered politely and with a bemused smile under my helmet. “For now, let’s just get to Thacea.”  

That little calling-out of Ilunor’s bluff seemed to stir something within both Thacea and Thalmin, as both met each other’s gaze for a moment, only for me to raise a single hand, calling off the argument as abruptly as it began.

“The floor is all yours, Thacea.” 

Thacea, with a cautious yet appreciative nod, continued with another wave of her hands; prompting another spike of mana radiation to precede a holographic projection of a sight that I had not at all expected. 

The world that now consumed our field of view, save for the coffee table that the sight-seer rested on and the couches we sat atop of, was a wooden galley. However, that in and of itself wasn’t the most unexpected part of this whole projection. No, the galley itself looked more than par for the course for your typical medieval-renaissance fantasy faire. 

What was decidedly *not* your typical fantasy faire was what was immediately in *front* of the ship. As the POV of this particular holographic recording wasn’t just staring out at some typical ye olde port with a cathedral or palace tower poking through a sea of low-rise structures.

No.

What we saw didn’t look like it couldn't have been built in the renaissance, or any other period in history that popular fantasy had requisitioned for its aesthetics. 

Because what we saw in front of us now, was undeniably, in every way possible… a city skyline.

Hundreds upon hundreds of towers rose above the sheer cliff faces of this island, forming what was in effect a coherent, cohesive, and strangely *modern* sight that looked absolutely out of place, especially from the vantage point of a wooden galley that looked like it’d been pulled out of the 15th century. 

I was about to raise a fair few questions about this, if not for the silent POV suddenly getting up from their seat, the whole perspective now turning to a precariously *unsecured* side of the vessel with not a single handrail, rope, or any sort of barrier existing between the ship’s deck and the open ocean below. 

The POV avinor paused for a moment, as if considering their next step, before suddenly and without warning *launching* themselves straight off the side of the ship. Hurling themselves at *maximum speed*, as fast as their chicken legs could muster, and for a moment losing altitude as they neared the waterline; before leveling out and then ascending straight *up*. The whole sequence took a total of barely ten or so seconds, but in those ten seconds, I could practically feel my gut *churning*. 

Ilunor, however, looked absolutely worse for wear if his dazed eyes and greening cheeks were of any indication. His bluff now falling flat as he all but needed to grip on tight to the plush armrests of his recliner to steady himself. 

The footage continued irregardless of the Vunerian’s condition however, as the video now felt like one of those high-quality nature docs that had a high-res camera strapped to the back of a migratory bird. 

As the world around us was now nothing but empty sky, and the ship beneath us continued to fade further and further away into the distance, until it was nothing but a small brown blob in the vast canvas of deep azure that was the ocean. 

These observations however didn’t remain valid for long. As without any warning save for a few high-pitched *chirps*, came an absolute *flurry* of colors in the form of an entire flock of birds. As the POV avinor in question joined what was ostensibly an entire *air lane’s* worth of fellow avinor. 

Avinors whose colors ranged from bright hot pink, to dull browns and beiges, to more colorful variants of blue, oranges, and reds. 

The entire flock flew in surprisingly coordinated unison through the clouds, before banking *hard* to the right, breaking through the cloud layer once more, rapidly approaching their intended destination - the city.

However, as we got closer, the finer details of these towers became increasingly more vivid; and with that came several revelations that started to frame this whole city in a more period-accurate light.

What were tall, modern skyscrapers from afar, now looked to be more akin to exceptionally elongated and stretched out towers of stone and concrete, with not a single structure containing more than a few panes of glass. 

And what I’d first assumed to be window frames from afar now revealed themselves to be far, *far* bigger than that. Clearly intended for something other than just looking out of. 

As every floor of every building contained what was in effect, some form of a balcony, with a wide open outcropping that could fit a whole avinor with their wings outstretched. 

These weren’t just decorative or aesthetic elements of design.

They were functional, in a way that I’d never thought to imagine before. 

From balconies to outcroppings to perches and more, these were elements of design that were conducive to the avinor lifestyle.

A lifestyle of *three dimensions*, unbound by the limitations of arms and legs, afforded to them by their gift of flight.

This was demonstrated almost immediately as the flock began to disperse upon entering into the city limits, as *hundreds* of them began their approach to several of the outlying towers at the outskirts of town, using those perches, balconies, and entrances exactly as I’d imagined them to. 

However, instead of entering any of those shorter buildings, our hologram’s POV began entering into what I could only describe as a *lane* of traffic. An invisible, non-demarcated series of flight paths that ran parallel and above to the city’s winding streets. Above and below us were distinct, seemingly never-ending lanes’ worth of avinor. Thousands of them commuted in these surprisingly accident-free and well regulated flight corridors, as if everyone instinctively *knew* the movements of another, as they all made micro adjustments to veer, swerve, shift, or alter their course in order to avoid mid-air collisions with their fellow commuters. 

This seemingly impossible and endless string of acrobatics continued as our POV flew their way between vast stretches of towers, eventually finding themselves barreling straight towards one. 

The flight lanes eventually dispersed, leaving only a few brave avinor to do what I’d only seen professional drone operators do for sport.

They flew straight *through* a skyscraper, entering through an admittedly large open balcony, flying through what *looked* to be a public concourse with a reception counter and concierge, passing by trolleys, couches, shelves, and even a precarious looking vase at one point, before flying out the other side of the building in the span of just a few seconds.

Everything felt like a complete blur by this point, but the real piece de resistance was still yet to come.

The avinor’s flightpath soon found themselves traveling into a part of the city that grew higher and higher with elevation, until finally, there was a strange, almost eerily empty clearing. A clearing that lasted for a good mile or so, acting as a buffer zone between the rest of the city and what was undoubtedly the seat of power of the whole place.

A stereotypical fantasy castle, with very little in the way of *practical* defenses compared to that of Thalmin’s home fortress. 

It looked as if someone had taken one of those *aesthetically-minded* ‘castles’ from the 19th century and simply *stretched* it out vertically. Creating something that was a cross between the Plaza Hotel from historic NYC, and one of those aforementioned 19th century castles built only for aesthetics in an era way *way* past the utilitarian age of castles. 

In fact, it looked eerily similar to that one particular castle that was prominently featured in that latest Civ building game as an ancient wonder…

Something starting with an N…

“EVI, help me out here. Search the historic databases for a castle in the EF, probably Germany or something. Something starting with an N. Featured recently in that civ game as a wonder. Something that rhymes with Lichtenstein.” 

**“Neuschwanstein Castle.”** The EVI responded blandly, bringing up the exact image of the castle I was looking for.

“THAT’S IT! Okay, thanks EVI.” 

**“Note: the name does** ***not*** **rhyme with the standard pronunciation of the state of Liechtenstein.”**

“Whatever, EVI, you at least got what I meant.”

“Soooooo Booker, what do you *think*?” An unfortunately familiar voice came in at the tail end of my back and forth with EVI, gesturing at the holographic projection.

I took a few seconds to come up with an answer. “I mean it’s-” 

But by that point, it was too late. 

“Hah! Awestruck by a slightly *above average* adjacent realm, are we now, Booker?” Ilunor couldn’t help but to butt in with a sly grin. 

“Not really, no. And erm, I don’t mean any offense by that of course, Thacea.” I addressed Thacea first, before shifting back to Ilunor. “In fact, the castle reminded me of a few structures we have back home.” 

Ilunor didn’t quite buy it, narrowing his eyes, and responded accordingly. “I *highly* doubt that to be the case, newrealmer-”

I promptly shut him down by grabbing my tablet, flipping it over, and displaying exactly what I’d most recently searched for. 

The Neuschwanstein Castle. 

This 19th century feat of engineering seemed to raise some eyebrows in Thalmin, garnering something of a respectable nod from Thacea, but seemed to only garner a shrug from Ilunor. 

“So you *don’t* live in mud and stick huts.” He spoke unenthusiastically. “What a surprise that the royal family of Earthrealm lives in a grand palace in the middle of the woods. Probably surrounded by the peasantry that took what… a hundred? A thousand years to painstakingly build what we can build in a blink of an eye?” He cackled incessantly.

“Nobody lives there, Ilunor.” I stated plainly. “It’s a historical site from a bygone era. We keep it because of its historic significance, and we keep the area around it wooded for the same reason. Or rather, environmental protection acts but that’s a whole other story. Suffice it to say, that’s *not* where our leaders reside. But… I guess you’ll see when I get to my realm.” 

I would savor the look on his face when we got to my demo. 

“Anyways, please do continue Thacea. I’m sorry for derailing your presentation.” I quickly added, prompting the princess to nod hesitantly in response, as if trying to gauge and pick apart the minor details of Earth just from that one image alone. 

“As I was saying, what you’ve just bore witness to was my home city, the capital of Aetheronrealm, the Isle of Towers. What you currently see here is the seat of the Royal family, the High Palace of Dilani.”

“So that’s where you live?” I shot back instinctively.

“Yes.” Thacea nodded. “More specifically, I spent most of my days confined to the tainted branch here.” The hologram projected a series of sparkly borders around one of the towers that jutted out laterally from the castle.

I nodded once, silently, not wanting to dig into that matter further. “Apologies if I brought up an awkward talking point, Thacea.” I openly apologized. 

“It’s quite alright, Emma.” Thacea responded with a polite chirp and just as quickly moved on. 

The rest of the city was promptly shown across the next thirty minutes, what amounted to a civilization built upon verticality and their gift of flight. 

Suffice it to say, there were *a lot* of questions following that demonstration, at least from my end as I began trying to pick apart *everything* Thacea had just shown us.

“So, are *all* avinor cities like this?” I began with an excitable breath.

“No, others rely more heavily on their natural surroundings to attain similar ends. With many cities having been carved into natural rock formations, cliff faces, and plateaus.” 

“Then why put all this effort into making the capital an artificial facsimile of what you could’ve more easily done with a cliff face?”

“The Isle of Towers has its roots in heavy historical legacy, Emma. Moreover, it began from desperation out of a group of avinor trapped from returning to the mainland due to a centuries-long storm. From there, they innovated, learning new magics to facilitate and accelerate means of both production and construction, allowing for the feats of engineering we now see today. Moreover, after the storms cleared, the isle became a hub of commerce as it sat between the flight-paths of the northern and southern migratory routes. Thus, after the Nexian reformation, it was quickly redesignated as the Aetheronrealm capital.”

I nodded silently all throughout, the EVI taking notes all throughout, and my own mind all but ravenously *consuming* this new bird-lore. 

“And-”

“Are we quite *finished* with this *Aetheronrealm* discussion, Booker?” Ilunor interjected. Although this time it wasn’t so much just pride talking, as I could visibly see him shaking from excitement.

Clearly giddy at the prospects of being *next*.

I craned my head towards Thacea. “Are you alright with continuing this Q and A at another time then, Thacea?”

The avinor princess nodded once in reply, prompting Ilunor to all but *cackle* excitedly with a gremlin-esque series of snickers, before running off to his room and bringing back his own sight-seeer. 

His device was fundamentally different from the pair’s. As unlike Thalmin’s, it looked *new*, and unlike Thacea’s, it was *sleeker*, with gold trimmings, silver finishes, and fine polish making it look like something out of a 27th century corpo lord’s modern art gallery. Even the crystals he inserted in seemed to glow *brighter*, and the iridescent fluid he used to power the whole thing was just that little bit more *lustrous*. 

“I hope you’re ready, newrealmer.” Ilunor began with a shit-eating grin on his face so wide that for a moment he looked like something straight out of a cartoon. “Because what you are about to see, is the result of the guiding light, the nurturing hand, and the awe-inspiring *power* of Nexian patronage.” 

The room around us was once more bathed in a white light, which transitioned seamlessly into yet another 3D panoramic experience. 

However, there was something different about this one.

Unlike the previous two’s projections that felt like there was a clearly defined POV, as if the whole thing was recorded from a single camera with all the drawbacks that came with it… this image felt eerily stable. It was as if we’d immediately jumped from a senior-high film project, to something of genuinely decent quality coming out of a legacy film house. 

The stabilized image I was met with was that of a vast expansive valley, one flanked on all sides by hilly terrain, with a seemingly endless expanse of mountainous peaks that crested in the background every which way we looked. 

“The trail of victory.” Ilunor began his unique brand of narration, contrasting Thalmin’s more rustic approach to his presentation, and Thacea’s minimalistic approach to hers. “The path of heroes. The road of success. Many names have been given to this long winding stretch of road. A pilgrimage that many a lesser-Vunerian, and those of partial draconic heritage must trek at least *once* in their small lives.” 

His words were somehow *reverberating* throughout the valley now, as if there was some sort of a sound projection system that had manifested around us.

“Though the names for it are many, and much of them are quite warranted, none come close to the name which I believe best suits the epic nature of that which is my home.” 

The scenery that surrounded us slowly, but surely, accelerated. Traveling down winding and twisting paths, until suddenly, it simply became a straight, uncompromising road. Paved, fenced, and well maintained for even industrial era standards, looking like something hailing from the age of concrete and asphalt, at around the dawn of paracrete and unisphalt.

The roads continued ever onwards, becoming more ambitious with its infrastructure projects as it crossed streams, rivers, lakes, and eventually… entire canyons and valleys. Bridge after bridge was crossed, each one grander and more elaborate than the next. With boring beam bridges eclipsed by arch bridges, then by suspension, then truss, then cantilever bridges, and so on and so forth. 

It was as if the Vunerian was trying to *also* demonstrate the superiority of his realm’s infrastructure; perhaps prompted by my earlier remarks on that very topic.

And to be honest… it showed, with many works of engineering looking as if they’d been pulled right out of early-modernity. 

This eventually culminated in a series of ambitious tunnels that ran *straight* through mountain after mountain, giving Norway a run for its money in the tunneling business.

These tunnels weren’t the bare stone type either, with each tunnel being entirely encased in a white seamless material, shiny, and similar to marble.

After about ten whole minutes of this fast-forwarded journey, which I imagine would’ve taken *days* if not *weeks* to accomplish by horseback and foot respectively, we finally arrived at an unusually large clearing. 

A large *flat* space, at the foot of several mountains.

However, as the ‘camera’ panned up, higher and higher still, our eyeballs forced to scale the sheer cliff-face that was the mountain, we suddenly reached a point where the mountain just… abruptly *stopped*.

About halfway up the tapering conical formation, where the midsection of the mountain *should* have been, was *nothing*.

Several double takes were taken by the whole gang, including myself, as we looked around us, staring at the *other* mountains that at first seemed normal, but upon closer inspection… had suffered the exact same fate.

All around us, were about seven mountains cleaved halfway up to their summits. A cut that looked so clean that it felt as if there was a graphical error, a bad glitch in the system, or some passable photo-doctoring going on.

“For I call it, the grand carpet to the throne at the foot of the heavens. A lengthy name, but I believe you will come to understand exactly *why* I believe that name to be most fitting.”

None of us responded, each of us transfixed in our own way as the video resumed its hastened pace, traveling closer and closer still until several oddities started becoming apparent. 

First, was the presence of *thousands upon thousands* of small outcroppings in the base of the mountain. Which, upon closer inspection, were open-air terraces. Terraces which housed entire air wings’ worth of drakes, all lined up, and sitting as if ready for action at a moment’s notice.

More details quickly became apparent as we abruptly scaled *up* the mountain, rising through a small layer of clouds to confirm what was hinted at from the foot of the mountain.

A perfectly *flat* surface at the midsection of a mountain, a result of a clean cut.

But what was *on* that flat surface however, was what was truly remarkable.

An entire *city*, a multi-tiered city that was divided not with walls, but with *height* itself. As what was a flat surface from first glance soon turned out to be a tiered landscape fashioned after a layer-cake. With each city layer separated by a good solid hundred or so feet of rock that went uncompromisingly up at a straight angle, repeating itself about ten distinct times, with each perfectly round and concentric layer becoming smaller and smaller with each change in elevation; before arriving at a large, grandiose, over-the-top castle that stood proudly at its peak.

The whole city looked sort of like the city of Omushu from Vatara: The Final Wind Shifter. 

“My home, my dear *peers*.” Ilunor announced proudly, allowing the video to continue on its own now, as we zipped straight through each of the layers of the city, going from the outermost layer that rivaled even Thalmin’s best developed areas in terms of its build quality and general aesthetics, through each of the layers that became increasingly more developed, more intricate in its designs, and sparser in its population. Most of the structures here were constructed out of a similar material to the paths that were paved between them - a pure-white stone that glistened in the sunlight. 

Open and public spaces were surprisingly abundant, as were literal *magma pits* surrounded by some sort of a wooded park that seemed entirely impervious to the heat permeating around them. 

“How-”

“I’m glad you asked, newrealmer.” Ilunor responded with a smarmy smile. “For you see, this was all the work of a single person. A *gift*, a *monument*, a practical military act, and a *message* all in one. All courtesy of his Eternal Majesty himself. Oh I’m sure we will touch upon it plenty in our history classes, but I would be remiss if I did not share a generous glimpse.” Ilunor continued, his speech interrupted by the occasional manic bout of pride-filled laughter. “This entire mountain range was once home to the seven great dragon clans of the past. And my people… were once all but unwitting *servants* to said clans. Bound to instincts… until the light of civilization opened their eyes. The elves in their infinite wisdom, and my immediate ancestors in their dissatisfaction with such a menial existence, decided to *civilize* the entirety of the region. We united to topple our draconic overlords, slaughtered them *all*, and in an act of brilliant strategic decision making, we decided to all but *destroy* the lairs with which these dragons once believed to be impregnable… by *carving open* the mountains themselves!” He announced with *glee*. “From there, the elves gifted us the former draconic lands, granting us stewardship over the entire region. We built our cities above where their lairs once stood, as a testament to our victory, of the triumph of civilization over animal savagery. Afterwhich, no longer were we known as mere *kobolds*— the elves elevating our race, imbuing my ancestors who fought alongside them with the gift of magic, creating *Vunerian-kind*.” 

My whole world all but *shattered* at that point, as what was in essence just a whole wall of lore completely rewrote everything I had initially assumed about the Vunerian. 

I turned to the pair first, gauging their reactions.

Their faces said it all however.

Or at least, Thalmin’s did.

Thacea remained unphased as was expected.

“But-”

“Oh, please maintain that shock and awe newrealmer, allow me to show you my home before we end this little *tour*.” Ilunor spoke cockily once more, descending down and towards one of the upper ringed tiers, just a few tiers shy of the palace that sat above the rest of the city. 

There, I saw an expansive mansion that would’ve put Versailles to shame. With a wide open lawn complete with a hedge maze and several magical artifacts keeping the maze itself constantly moving. Its architecture was *gaudy* too, with elements of baroque infused with high-gothic, all in the form factor of a corpo boss’ preference for *size* over practicality.

“So, newrealmer… what do you think? I doubt there’s anything in your newrealm that can match the grandeur of a crownlands-affiliate Nexian realm, even *with* that acceptably *mediocre* castle you just showed.”

I let out a sigh, turning towards Ilunor with a tired look in my eyes as I just about was ready to drop the bombshell on him.

A proverbial one of course, as this wasn’t a game of *war*, but a game of political might through a game of boastful displays.

Thankfully, this was modern humanity we were talking about.

So even a tour of my *hometown* as it were should be enough to settle things.

**“Have you dictated a course of action, Cadet Booker?”**

“Yeah, so, major themes I’m seeing here are home, hometown, city, urban development, as well as everything else more or less in between those topics that I can’t come up with right now.”

**“Affirmative Cadet Booker. Query: By hometown, do you wish to bring up your heritage town, or the Acela Megacity?”**

“Why not both?” I responded earnestly. “Both would honestly be good. Have them see the smallest of the small scale communities, then bump it up to the one of the largest cities on Earth. Should be fun right?”

**“Affirmative. Loading stated parameters now.”**

“I’m going to have to politely allow my presentation to speak for itself, Ilunor. So let’s head on over to my room. I’m afraid my *sight-seer* requires a bit more space so let’s get going.”

(Author’s Note: Hey everyone! I have an announcement to make. To keep it brief, I’m afraid I’m going to have to announce a temporary pause to posting for the next 2 weeks. This comes as a result of me being unable to change my shifts at work like I generally am able to do because most of the attending staff are going to be heading to holiday over the coming few weeks, which leaves little wiggle room with me swapping with other people from my rotation. As a result I don’t think I’ll be able to maintain the usual posting schedule without compromising on quality assurance of chapters and the standards I typically want the chapters to be. What I want most is to make sure that I can deliver as good a chapter as I can. But I’m unable to do that with the current situation with my work and studies. So with that being said, I hope this is alright with everyone. I guarantee though that we'll get back to the usual schedule after all this is done! I hope you guys have a great holiday season! :D **The next Chapter is already up on Patreon if you guys are interested in getting early access to future chapters!**)

comment,,2023-12-17 18:13:27,"Surprisingly informative presentation by Ilunor, though probably unintentionally so. His desire to brag has given us confirmation on how the Nexus does business, and a follow-up (FINALLY) on the 'systematic species alteration' clue from dozens of chapters ago.

So, the Nexus did the ol' regime destabilization play on the dragons, then did the mana-tech version of an uplift on the kobolds, presumably amping up their mana manipulation abilities. Presto, a brand new client state. This reaffirms that the Nexians like being the only game in town, and to maintain the status quo, genocide is just another tool in their kit. Peace with Earth will not be an option, and it never was.

Now I'm REALLY interested in seeing the gang's reaction to what humans look like. Most species we've seen so far can be seen as some kind of uplifted sapient (mana tech style), with the 'gold standard' being the Elven form. What will they make of a species whose natural form is basically shorter, stockier, round-eared elves?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/18kltuh/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_60/kdruzd6/,,Wearing Power Armor to a Magic School (60/?)
comment,,2023-12-17 18:32:22,"Yup! Ilunor couldn't help but to have revealed the deep lore of his realm! Moreover, he has all the motivation to do so as well given that his realm is distinct from that of the rest of the gang's, and he wants to show it off! :D 

But yes, this bit of the chapter was me attempting to demonstrate just how far Nexian power can actually go, and that they're actually a force to be reckoned with on scales that are exponentially more powerful and impressive when compared to that of the typical adjacent realm. That's how they've maintained their monopoly on power for so long after all, and that's also why they're a worthy opponent of humanity.

Like I've said before, I always wanted to write a story where there's both parity and non parity between magical worlds and a sci fi humanity. The Adjacent realms are your typical magical realms that you'd imagine even modern humanity to have a good shot against. The Nexus however is a different beast entirely and is actually worthy of a sci fi humanity to go toe to toe against! :D The story has always been slowly leading up to that, and this is our first true taste of what I have planned for that going forward! :D Or at least I hope it worked as I intended it to haha. 

Also yup! The elves know a thing or two about regime destabilization tactics and propping up friendly governments, regimes, and then changing the records to fit their narrative! 

As for the gang's reaction to what humans look like, that's a major point that will be explored a bit later as it's going to be more than a shock to realize that humans look eerily similar to elves, especially when compared to every other realm that's been encountered so far! :D",,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/18kltuh/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_60/kdry1od/,,Wearing Power Armor to a Magic School (60/?)
comment,,2023-12-17 19:05:50,"I am _very_ much looking forward to the next chapter, and I completely understand how it is with the holidays!

But you had better believe that I'm eager to read it!

And yeah, I'm not sure that Ilunor is going to be capable of understanding _why_ Emma's opinion of his entire civilization took a bit of a nose dive with that presentation, or at least with his comments at the end.

Though, I suspect that even the smallest trace of pity is going to rankle a lot more.

They are all intimately aware that they owe their very _being_ sapient beings to the Elves.

They live in cities which are monuments to the power of the Nexus.

Their very history is not of their own grand accomplishments, but in what the Elves did 'for them'.

And on a scale that they have absolutely no hope of ever being able to match.

Sure, _Emma's_ civilization could almost certainly do the same things, but at this point, well, they _wouldn't_.

And it would take a very long time, even knowing that it was even possible, to build up to that level of power...  And the Nexus would never, _ever_, allow that to happen.

(And for those who don't spot it, currently they have exactly _zero_ hope of ever being able to match that power.  His realm has significantly less magic than the Nexus does.  That means that the Nexus can bring power to play that his realm is simply incapable of, as what would seem to be a straight law of the universe.)",,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/18kltuh/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_60/kds3epi/,,Wearing Power Armor to a Magic School (60/?)
comment,,2023-12-18 10:06:24,"Just pointing out- the Library seems to know some sort of secret lore concerning Vunerian nobility. (Given how it spoke secretly to Ilunor to get him to consent to his 'parole')

Somehow I'm getting the vibe that there's some secret aspect to the whole ""Dragon rebellion"" and ""Kobold Uplift"" that I can't wait to learn more about.

# Disclaimer:

Please don't false report a raid guide just because it helps more people clear Contest mode (100k+ guardians and counting!). I can understand if it's because this post might be too in depth/detailed to the point of overextended, but hating a guide because **it helps people** is weird. Be better.

I'm going to make [a backup copy of this thread on my own page](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThankYouMrSotarks/comments/11ocutt/root_of_nightmares_raid_guide_backup_repost_from/), ~~since having issues with mod approvals may interfere with those that are seeking help.~~ WE ESCAPED MOD JAIL YIPPEE. Still keeping the backup just in case it happens again.

Welcoming any support to help explain **ANY** of the encounters as I am a little bit lost myself.

Will be refreshed once every hour (or as close as possible to that timeframe) for more information.

edit 2: site is slowed down due to traffic, but I'm going to try and gather information as much as I am able to.

edit 3: added imgur links for encounter maps.

edit 4: updated explanation for Macrocosm with new graphs.

edit 5: updated with Triumph details. \*\***Need help with figuring the Challenge conditions for encounters for Triumphs.\*\***

# SECRET CHEST #1:

&gt;On the way to the second encounter, there's an area where psions are shooting at you from three entrances high above. The secret chest is in there after killing the tormentor in the area.

# SECRET CHEST #2:

&gt;Second chest is in the second jumping puzzle. Turn around at the stair area. There is the darkness switch at the end of the jumping puzzle opening the second chest's door. It can be found by jumping around the outside before going into the room with the door leading to the stairs.

**OPENING:**

Players will spawn in and begin to traverse toward the first encounter. Nothing much was noted in this area besides the scenery and [a symbol(?) on the high gate at the beginning](https://i.imgur.com/ZWalgai.png). Will be updated more if necessary.

Added a secret puzzle section at the bottom of the thread.

**CATACLYSM:**

Map: [https://i.imgur.com/9GjCXyo.png](https://i.imgur.com/9GjCXyo.png)

Map (Alternate) by pryanie#2536: [https://i.imgur.com/IxbmUBg.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/IxbmUBg.jpeg)

First encounter starts after shooting the mini Traveler orb/ball that is in front of the rally banner. The objective is to transfer the orb from one side of the arena to the other by passing it through nodes, or spirals, in the arena. The person within the aura of the orb that shoots it will be given a buff, **""Field of Light""** (Buff cooldown is ready whenever you see the aura around the ball).

The entire fireteam will be given a debuff timer, **""Sweeping Terror""**, which is essentially a wipe mechanic. Enemies will start spawning, including Barrier Champion Cabals and 2 Psions in their bubbles. Killing these Psions will then spawn a Tormentor, which is **required to be killed** in order to extend Sweeping Terror's timer and also to spawn **the next Darkness Spiral nodes**, which alternate spawn sides.

The Traveler ball directs you to a darkness spiral (node) where a little orb will spawn in the spiral. If you have the buff it will be consumed and it will create another Traveler ball at **the initial plate/spawn**, which will then emit a light arrow/pointer that leads you to another spiral. In order to make the next node appear, you will need to kill the Tormentor that spawns. Repeat until **""His hatred halts""** and another starting point will appear to the right of the initial starting location.

**Additional tips for encounter:**  Break into 2 teams, 2/4 (Team 1 should be 2 people, team 2 is the remaining 4). Team 1 is the Linker/Gardener team which uses the light buff to connect the trees together. Team 2 is a roaming death squad that needs to punch psions and kill tormentors as fast as possible. Once Team 1 has finished connecting 4-5\~ nodes then the timer stops. If a tormentor is alive leave it up until the next timer for more time. Ad clear in the downtime. Repeat 4\~ times and you are done.

After the encounter is finished, proceed through the opened path and climb the white roots (of nightmares) to reach the second encounter.

At the gap, shoot the Resonance node (same as Vow encounters) to activate the booper (you WILL be flung).

&amp;#x200B;

**SCISSION:**

Map: [https://i.imgur.com/toIjVVy.png](https://i.imgur.com/toIjVVy.png)

Similar mechanics to the first Cataclysm encounter, moving light from node to node, but now there is a light side and a dark side.  You will split into 2 teams of 3 and rebuff in the aura with your group and go where the balls point. Shoot ball of light on either side of arena to get the **Field of Light** buff. An orb of darkness on either side also has to be shot, this will remove **Field of Light**. **Imminent Expulsion** timer wipes you cause it pushes you off. After all orbs are cleared on both sides of arena the Imminent Expulsion debuff will be removed (wall mechanics) &amp; minibosses spawn on both sides. The tricky part is it goes back and forth **over the gap**. There are also Centurions with auras that **only people with that buff can kill**, so be careful and stay buffed.

Once the first level is done, the launcher at the far end of the room will boop you to the second level where you do the same thing. You **must clear Centurions** to be able to boop up. Rinse &amp; repeat for 3 levels.

Boopers (we're keeping this terminology) are kinda dangerous, you have to make sure you're all the way back against them when you activate otherwise it can send you straight up OR send you directly into the wall on the other side. (You can wellskate or just use swords to help with movement adjustments to go across.)

u/DrDukeMD offers [his team's sketch](https://i.redd.it/xplyxnatu9na1.png) of the 3 floors for the encounter:

\*\*\* u/duffking shares their strat for this encounter:

&gt;2 teams of 3, allocate a runner and two killers. The runner connects the dots by themselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;After each dunk:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Runner returns to the buff spawn  
&gt;  
&gt;\- One of the killers returns to the buff spawn to refresh their buff (for killing the shield)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- One of the killers remains on add control  
&gt;  
&gt;Just alternate which killer returns each time, this way someone always is able to kill the shields and someone is always on add control. You have more than enough time to do 5 plates as the 2 that are on the same side as you start are always really quick to reach.

\*\* If you get soft-locked at the end and cant get buffs, use colony. Run into them and shoot at your feet to bypass the shields. (HOW THO?)

\* Goofy silly off-topic detail: If you're still on the checkpoint for the second encounter and then go back, you will see an A-posing Tormentor somewhere on the map (unsure of the exact location). ~~Probably related to the 2nd secret chest.~~ Some are saying him being immune makes them unable to get the 2nd secret chest(?). Unsure about this.

&amp;#x200B;

# ABOUT DISRUPTION ON THE FIRST AND SECOND ENCOUNTER:

&gt;it's confusing as it's easy to accidentally cause a disrupt and think it's something else doing it but I'm fairly sure it's this: **Disrupt occurs when a player is holding the buff and is not within the aura you have to stand to get the buff, and another player grabs the buff.** If you want multiple players to have the buff, they must grab it at the same time.The disrupt stops you from grabbing the buff for a few seconds.The psions/tormentor and the majors in the second encounter don't disrupt you, however their presence appears to stop you dunking the buff at the plates.We were confused so we tested it out during the second encounter and it seemed pretty reliably to be caused by the above. Happy to eat my words if that's not the case though.

**JUMPING PUZZLE:**

idk just do it. also there's a chest (refer to Secret Chest #2).

Every member of the fireteam must be near the doors for it to open. Credits to u/PT153 for pointing it out.

Room is split into 3, with a center area, a left, and a right side. Both the left and right sides contain 6 planets respectively, both in the shape of triangles. Each planet is located at the tip of a triangle, and each planet has a random polarity of Light or Dark. The left side will always start with 4 Light and 2 Dark, and the right will be 4 Dark and 2 Light.

When you start the encounter, you'll have to clear ads out in the middle until Centurions spawn. After you kill the Centurions, 4 Colussus will spawn, one on each triangle. When you kill a Colussus on your side, you'll be able to see the ""polarity"" of your side's planets (which ones are Dark and which ones are Light).

The point of the encounter is to shift all of the Darks to the right side, and the Lights to the left side. Starting on the lower triangles, make the call for which ones are the odd ones out, and then 1 person from each side will walk underneath the planets when the Colossuses are killed, there will be these buffs that you can pick up underneath each of your side's planets. Your job is to take the buff of the planet that is the odd one out and ""carry"" the planet to the opposite side.

It is important to note that **only the person who kills the Colossus** can see the polarity of planets, and **only their side's polarities**, and **can only take from their side's planets** (i.e if you were on right and you killed a Colossus on the right side, you wouldn't be able to see anything on the left side). You have 3 rounds of Centurions to do this correctly, so you could technically mess up once. You could have 2 people start on the bottom triangle, call out their odd ones, and then take the odd ones to the opposite odd ones. When you both insert the buffs, the planets will physically move and switch places

Make sure that it looks like [this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1083887245448204351/1083888756098093196/image.png). Once it looks like the image, you can begin preparing for DPS phase. Another Centurion and Colossus will spawn as per usual, but when you kill this Colossus you'll also be able to see the center planets' polarities. [This is an example](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1083887245448204351/1083889649652596826/image.png), but it can be random. As far as we know, there will ALWAYS be at least one of each, so you should just call out, in this example, ""Dark left"" because we know the other two would be light.

Once this call has been made, you do the same thing as before with the planet ""buffs"" underneath the planets, taking, for the above example, **any** 2 Light planets and **any** 1 Dark planet and dunking them in the plates on the ground below the planets. If done right within the allotted time, the planets will combine and you will begin the damage phase.

The boss will either be **orange** or **white.** If it's **white**, stand in the **white plate** and do damage. If it's **orange**, stand in the **orange plate** and do damage. The boss will only change to a color that one of the plates is, and when you are finished with a plate it will no longer be usable.

Once you do this enough times, you will reach final st^(r)and, where all plates will be orange and **you are free to damage from wherever.** The plates don't disappear, you just stick one and melt it.

1. Respawns the centurions if you need to retry the planet swapping, and
2. Starts damage if your team is standing on the correct plate

**NEZAREC:**

~~^(woo yeah it's nezarec time)~~

Map 2 (Alternate) made by pryanie#2536: [https://i.imgur.com/4cfrqJb.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/4cfrqJb.jpeg)

Boss fight with Nezarec.

Similar mechanics to first and second encounter, have 1-2 people run around and connect nodes/seeds (Eager Edge sword helps). In order to start damage phase, you must chain the seeds/nodes on both sides from start to finish. While people are doing this, others should be shooting Nezarec's weak points (same as Rhulk). These crit spots/weak points could only be hit to extend the timer once for each spot. Once both shoulders and the chest are popped, he will flash either light or dark, signifying the type of wipe he will perform.

To delay the wipe, you must get the refuge buff matching the wiping element Nezarec is performing. For Example, if Nezarec flashes/emits a white wave after shooting his weak points, you must grab the Darkness Aura and bring it to an activated light node. Shooting the node will grant immunity to the wipe mechanic to all nearby players. (credits to u/userp17 for this section)

Stand on the platform (the final Light seed spot) in order to do DPS phase. Well there, don't move too much, and your team should be fine to do damage.

\*Wipe timer is also **permanently shorter**(??) after the first phase of DPS (will need to verify).

Boss will need at least 2-3 damage phases. Also has a final strand (hehe).

# DPS:

a couple of proposed team setup has been Merciless/rocket(or LMG) or Thunderlords with catalyst, fairly consistent, do keep in mind.

# IMPORTANT NEZAREC WIPE MECHANIC NOTE:

&gt;You can survive Nezarec by shooting his shoulder to see a blast in either light or darkness. Once you know that, the player running the opposite type will have to go to an already captured node matching the type of the boss and shoot it to give your team a shelter buff when you step into it. After that, you can continue connecting the things until DPS.  
&gt;  
&gt;E.g the second shoulder pop is orange, then the Light chain stops at node 4 for example, uses the buff to shot darkness node 1 or 2, behind the darkness aura node. Every player can step into it and get a darkness shelter buff to survive the wipe.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Update tips for Final Boss  
&gt;  
&gt;You can survive his wipe explosion!  
&gt;  
&gt;When you shoot off his shoulders, he'll glow either Light or Dark for a secondUpon knowing this information, create either a Light of Dark Refuge!  
&gt;  
&gt;Light Refuge needs to have the Dark runner shoot a completed Light PointDark Refuge needs to have the Light runner shoot a completed Dark Point(YOU MUST HAVE THE BUFF WHEN CREATING THE POOL)(The Refuge Zones can't be made on points where the buff needs to be grabbed from)  
&gt;  
&gt;The Buff lasts for 15 seconds or infinite if you sit in the refuge pool  
&gt;  
&gt;If  you have the respective Refuge, you WILL survive his explosion and  he'll reset back to the top where he started all over again.

# SECRET PUZZLE(?):

There are secret areas throughout the raid which might be related to getting the guaranteed red border on raid completion at the end of the last encounter(?).

The opening area also includes a light and dark seed/orb that can be shot at ([has valid hitmarkers](https://imgur.com/a/HmkV123))credits to u/Kubiboi for the image and u/Fusion5432 for pointing it out.

&gt;u/Fusion5432: Seems those 3 “seeds” are like the hive code, pertaining on which seeds need to be connected in the rooms

post,CMV: To solve the housing crisis we should just break up real estate empires and limit the # of homes any one person/entity can own,2021-09-27 03:10:00,"If we broke up real estate empires and capped the number of homes that individuals and companies can own, it would force them to sell and drive the prices back down to real-world, while opening up housing to people who need it.
- Why not cap individuals at say, 5 homes (generously)
- Smaller real estate companies could own, say, 20-50 and be taxed at a smaller rate
- Cap the size of large real-estate companies to prevent them from amassing thousands of homes
- Titrate the limits over say 5-10 years to allow staggered sell-off
- Institute a nation-wide property tax on someone's 4th or more home (who needs more than a house, a summer, and a winter house) that funds first-time mortgages &amp; housing assistance 
- Obviously do more to cap AirBnB whales
- Ban foreign countries/entities from buying investment real estate in the US.

It's so disheartening that this isn't the national conversation. Both dems and gop both either say:
""We should just eliminate single-family zoning to build giant condos""
   or...
""We should expand urban boundary lines and build more""

My point is, there are already enough homes in the country (assuming this as common knowledge). The problem is, no one can afford them, or they never get back on the market. You can *try* to legislate price/rent control but it's not going to work everywhere or last. Urban boundary lines likewise exist to protect any number of things, such as habitats, traffic, distribution, and general quality of life (not to mention climate change). And, as someone in a raging gentrification zone myself, I don't see the efficacy of building condos that working-class people can't afford, driving up prices even more, and pricing families out of their homes. There are a lot of ways to label housing as ""low-income"" but really not have it be affordable.

The general point is, tons of companies have hoovered up mass quantities of homes (of all kinds and sizes) and will never, ever turn around and say ""Hey, family of 3 who needs a starter, let me sell you this at a fair price.""

Using market forces, force a sell-off and re-circulate the homes that are being hoarded.

Open to any and all discussion, thanks!

**update**

Really really good responses from people, great conversation and diverse views. Definitely sticking to my main theory, but with a few changed-views some compelling counter-arguments:
- Foreign property acquisition is probably the biggest thing to target (not small landlords)
- Most empty homes are in places people don't want to move to, many thoughts on what/why/how to address
- lowering housing prices/values would just drown mortgage-holders so that's not an ideal goal
- Prohibiting owning too many homes wouldn't work in US politics, but you could (de)incentivize probably
- Root cause of people not owning homes is stagnated wages, huge cost of living, diminished middle-class opportunities
- Building more houses will always be a key part of the solution, but it has to be done responsibly
- Housing assistance, public housing and supporting first-time home buyers should be big priorities

(I still think we should target big real estate empires, but I'm not an expert on how).

This is false.

The problem is *nobody wants to live in flyover country* which comprises roughly 50% of available housing.

What we actually need to do is begin to have states like California tax the living hell out of billionaire corporations and encourage them to move to states with lower tax burdens. Places like Portland and Austin started with tax breaks for companies in specific industries and now they are mega cities in the span of 15-20 years. It's because large business built campuses in these locations.

Silicon Valley is a huge concentration of wealth and labor, and eventhough Covid has changed the way we approach work, people seeking education and wealth are bound to move to coastal states which is why there's  the perception of a shortage. Demand is location based when it comes to housing. You can have housing in bum fuck nowhere for pennies, people just don't want to live in bumfuck nowhere.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/pw6k5o/cmv_to_solve_the_housing_crisis_we_should_just/hef698m/,,CMV: To solve the housing crisis we should just break up real estate empires and limit the # of homes any one person/entity can own

When they move into the fancy new apartment it opens their old place for other people to live in which increases availability of housing and lowers prices for everyone.

There's many studies that show this. [Here](https://cityobservatory.org/building-more-housing-lowers-rents-for-everyone/) is a discussion about one study released last year in Germany. A 1% increase in homebuilding led to a .5% decrease in rents.

So with that being said, the melanin is only changed based of how much heat is released by the sweat. If you are darker it’s cause your skin had to adapt to the heat release which the sweat carries and takes off of you. Ironic but this is a good example of the survivorship bias. Bodies that sweat to release water actually survive longer than those that hold it in.

post,NFL Power Rankings heading into the fourth quarter of the 2025 season,2025-12-11 12:51:09,"https://preview.redd.it/5vwjb67drj6g1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8a6797b3665c7eb18bb335bba2dbc1fe18efbee

.

We’re three quarters through the 2025 NFL season and it’s time for one more look at all 32 teams. As always, please bear in mind that these are power \*rankings\* rather than standings. So you may see one team be listed above another with a better record or even one they’ve already lost to head-to-head at some point – the objective is to weigh them against the rest of the league at large, and how many opponents I’d favor them over. Especially, as playoff seedings are starting to materialize, we’re somewhat looking ahead at who can go the distance, even though this is more meant to be a snapshot of this moment.

I took injuries into account and weighed current form more heavily, while compared to earlier in the season, we have a pretty good picture of what teams are in all three facets of the game. Although you’ll find a variety of statistics and advanced metrics to support my arguments, they’re all primarily grounded in having watched every single matchup up to this opponent, either on the broadcast, the All-22, or both.

**I'm happy to engage in any discussions and disagreements, but please stay respectful and don't insinuate that I didn't put enough work into this.**

Let’s get to the full rankings:

.

.

# 1. Los Angeles Rams (10-3)

When I ranked the Rams as the number two team in the NFL back [after the first month of the season](https://halilsrealfootballtalk.com/2025/10/01/nfl-power-rankings-after-the-first-quarter-of-the-2025-season/), there was outrage, especially for putting them ahead of the Eagles, who they had previously lost against on a potential game-winning field goal being blocked. Right now, even though there are two AFC contenders that have an extra win on their resume, I believe they pretty clearly belong at the top of the list. Even if their week 13 loss to the Panthers served as a reminder that anyone can be beaten if they lose the turnover battle, nobody has really been able to stop their offense since they traveled to London prior to their week eight bye, when they started to diversify their personnel groupings. They’re in a league of their own when you look at EPA per play (0.226) and success rate (55.8%) since that point, while their run game has continued to ascend. Meanwhile, their defensive line has the ability to take over games, as one of only two teams with four players inside the top-50 in pressures, and while their offense is basically impossible to defend in goal-line situations, only the Broncos have kept opponents out of the end zone once they’ve reached the red area at a higher rate (42.5% TD rate) than this group. It’s the Rams and their division rivals in a tier of their own currently when it comes to overall DVOA, Matt Stafford is your MVP front-runner, and they’re understandably the betting favorites for the Super Bowl.

.

# 2. Seattle Seahawks (10-3) 

For the Seahawks, even though the offensive side of the ball has been the story based on how we viewed this team coming into the year, we have to start with this devastating defense. They’re the other unit I mentioned with four names inside the top-50 for defensive pressures, and they actually have six guys with 30+ (the cut-off for the top-50 being 36). They can send waves at quarterbacks, which is paired with various looks up front that are beautifully married to what they do on the back-end, and then all of the guys they put out there, just fly around the field. Second-round pick Nick Emmanwori becoming Mike Macdonald’s new version of Kyle Hamilton as a Swiss Army knife, has been huge in becoming number one in schedule-adjusted DVOA. Now, offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak’s vision for Sam Darnold quarterbacking this heavy personnel, hyper-aggressive play-action attack, is what has me believing in them being the biggest threat to their NFC West foes – as we saw with a 61-yard field goal miss being the difference in their initial matchup in L.A., when Sam had by far his worst showing of the season. As they’ve at least become an average rushing team to complement the way they want to operate, with Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s historic year being the driving force behind the number one offense in net yards per dropback (8.2 yards average), they can beat anyone as long as they don’t give the ball away excessively.

.

# 3. Green Bay Packers (9-3-1) 

Even after their 2-1-1 start heading into their bye week, I had pretty high hopes for the Packers, and they’ve actually moved up by a couple of spots in my rankings since then. With the valleys and peaks of their quarterback and offense altogether, I got a bit more concerned for a while, but now they’ve ripped off wins by 7+ points against all three of their divisional opponents these past three weeks, with Jordan Love performing at the highest level we’ve seen from him yet. Sure, there’s a pass or two every week that has you scratching your head because he tried to force a deep ball into double-coverage or a throw into a super tight window, but the down-to-down consistency, even with his tendencies of fading away unnecessarily, has been excellent. Love ranks number one in EPA per dropback (0.303), as Christian Watson has established himself as a vertical threat again, and you felt the gravity of Jayden Reed as more of their designed touch option, just coming back off injured reserve. They’re the only team to convert better than half of their third-down attempts and they’re second in red zone touchdown percentage (68.1%). Meanwhile, the Packers D is one of the most under-discussed units in the league. While they could still use better contributions from guys up front along with Micah Parsons, who ranks third in total QB pressures individually (74), they haven’t been as reliant on takeaways as last year. Recently losing Devonte Wyatt for the rest of the season is a bummer, but they’re even more cohesive in the way they command space in coverage and the situational awareness they show in year two under DC Jeff Hafley, which is how they rank seventh in dropback success rate surrendered (43.9%).

.

# 4. Denver Broncos (11-2)

While we can have a discussion about Green Bay getting the nod, I do believe there’s a defined drop-off from the top of the NFC to the pair of teams atop the AFC, even if they have that extra win in their pockets. I don’t quite look at either one of them as being as complementary as their counterparts. Having said that, they deserve to be up here by routinely taking care of who’s been put in front of them. The Broncos embody that idea more than anyone in the league. Now winners of ten straight, they’ve had a couple of dominant showings, they’ve grinded out some low-scoring affairs, they’ve rallied in the fourth quarter with Bo Nix suddenly flipping the script when needed, they’ve had some key plays on special teams, and they’ve fended off their opponents when they did have chances. Currently, their defense is right on pace for the all-time record for sacks in a season (72), Vance Joseph is a mad scientist with how he ties the front- and back-end together (as I broke down in [my most recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW4mcbDIr9I)), and they just got back reigning DPOY Pat Surtain at corner. They rank number one in third-down (30.9%) and red zone TD percentage (40.0%). The offense remains kind of a rollercoaster, which is why I made the distinction to the two top-ranked teams. Denver’s run game has been more feast-or-famine since J.K. Dobbins got hurt, and while that can bring an element of unpredictability, you don’t know which pass-catcher to rely upon on a weekly basis. Nonetheless, they’ve been able to put points on the board when needed most, as Bo has been credited with an NFL-best six game-winning drives, and no team has surrendered sacks at a lower rate (3.5%).

.

# 5. New England Patriots (11-2)

The story for the Pats is quite different. I actually believe their quarterback Drake Maye has been the engine that has powered this team to a shocking ten-game win streak of their own. While we can argue that Matthew Stafford has played the position at the highest level this season and Josh Allen remains the biggest force of nature in the league, I would throw in that nobody has created more with less than this second-year starter. Even with the much-maligned last-place schedule they’ve faced, you can’t deny the ability to mitigate negative plays behind a below-average O-line, and how he’s pushed the ball vertically for big plays (140.0 passer rating on throws of 20+ air yards). That’s where the fact that this is a team-oriented ranking comes into play, however, as they’re largely relying on role players around the QB in a well-coached offense under Josh McDaniels, while ranking 30^(th) in rushing success rate (34.4%). Defensively, it’s kind of a similar story, where they’ve relied on a bunch of rookies and lower-tier free agents to fill in spots, especially with their one big-ticket item Milton Williams on injured reserve, but they’re so multiple in the fronts they present, how they change the picture on quarterbacks and then they just enforce their will on opponents with the way they’re laying the wood. They’ve fallen off a little bit in that regard, but they’re still allowing just under 90 rushing yards per game, they rarely miss tackles, and then they’re a nightmare for protections with all the movement thrown at them post-snap. It’s not a perfect metric, but ranking 14^(th) in team DVOA is at least a point of concern going forward.

.

# 6. Buffalo Bills (9-4) 

When the Bengals were setting up 1^(st) &amp; 10 from the Buffalo 33-yard line with five-and-a-half minutes left in the fourth quarter this past Sunday, it certainly didn’t feel like this is where the Bills would end up finding themselves. Christian Benford snatching a pick-six after getting to Joe Burrow on a corner blitz earlier and then getting another interception off a batted pass completely turned the tables for a defense that has largely struggled this season. Against the run in particular, opponents have been able to routinely take advantage of their unwillingness to alter personnel and some of the fits opponents have pushed them into, as they rank 31^(st) in rush EPA (0.045), and I even made a [video specifically on that topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvbsRayxI9E). Yet, if they can simply get one or two of these takeaways per week, Superman can carry the day for them, including in a snowstorm. What we’re seeing from Buffalo’s offense right now is their best version of themselves. Rookie tight-end Jackson Hawes, who functions almost like an extra tackle on run plays, has somewhat replaced their six-offensive linemen sets, yet he can sneak out on play-action a couple of times a game, once they’ve hammered away with James Cook (although he needs to protect the ball better). And then Josh Allen can put on the cape when needed, where he provides deadly throws out of structure and scrambles, including when they do spread opponents out more. They’re now back up to the top-three in success rate (48.3%) and EPA per play (0.141) offensively.

# 7. Houston Texans (8-5)

Is there a more fun unit to watch right now than this Texans defense? I already extensively talked about [the tandem of Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW4mcbDIr9I) off either edge and how they play off each other recently, but the way they swarm to the football and the physicality even their defensive backs bring to the table, gives them an attitude that really gets you excited. You could tell Jalen Pitre de-cleating Chiefs receivers earlier in the game got into the heads of those guys as they thought about extending for the ball this past Sunday night. That duo up front being top-six in all pass-rush-relevant metrics each, paired with the way they challenge opponents during their routes, and then the range of someone like Calen Bullock from the deep post makes them a nightmare for any quarterback. They’re at the bottom of the league in blitz and disguise rate, yet they’re allowing an NFL-low 16 points per game. Offensively, it’s been more of a struggle at times, trying to get the run game cracked up and C.J. Stroud continuing to look uncomfortable behind leaky protections, which also got him knocked out for three-and-a-half games. They still rank 29^(th) in rushing success rate (34.5%), but they’ve at least become a little more effective in short-yardage situations, and some of these young receivers around Nico Collins have started to step up. Understanding they can play through their defense, they’ve really limited turnovers, with just one total over the past month, and even when they stagnated at Kansas City, Stroud was able to deliver a handful of plays out of structure. They’re now the number one in the [HRF.com](http://HRF.com) statistic, beginning their drives 4.6 yards further ahead than their opponents on average.

.

# 8. Detroit Lions (8-5)

The 2025 season was kind of hanging in the balance this past Thursday Night against the surging Cowboys, after just getting swept by the Packers, yet they were able to access a gear on offense that had kind of been missing in previous weeks. They’ve fallen to dead-average (17^(th)) in rushing success rate for the year (41.5%), but Jahmyr Gibbs is so explosive that he can rip off massive chunks whenever he is given room to operate, which Detroit has utilized more as a receiver as well. We’ve felt the presence of Jameson Williams as their big-play threat through the air more since Dan Campbell has taken over play-calling duties, and they just had a vintage moment to seal this past win, when they called up a heavy play-action concept against Dallas, selling out for the run. For the year, they’re number one in yards per play (6.2). Detroit’s defense surrendering 89 total points over these last three weeks is more alarming, but generally, I’ve been pretty impressed with what Kelvin Sheppard has done as a first-year coordinator. Adjusting for schedule, they rank sixth in defensive DVOA. Once again, injuries have really taken a toll on this unit, especially in the secondary, which will only get worse with Brian Branch now headed for IR with a torn Achilles. So, they’re hoping for better health once we get to this next calendar year, they’re only allowing 3.9 yards per rush, and they do have the league’s leader in pressures Aidan Hutchinson (80). Without some of these contributors on the back-end, they’ll need to adjust their man-heavy tendencies going forward, however.

# 9. San Francisco 49ers (9-4) 

First and foremost, it‘s pretty incredible how we got here, when we could easily be sitting here with the Niners record flipped and talk about the myriad of injuries they‘ve suffered. To be without clearly their two most integral defenders in Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, yet somehow have all these guys stepping up, looking this well-prepared and energetic, is a major credit to Robert Saleh. They’re dead-last in sacks (16) and you can move the ball on them, but they’re allowing points on the eighth-lowest percentage of drives against (36.2%). At the same time, we also have to commend Kyle Shanahan‘s patience with the run game whilst navigating through Brock Purdy being either hurt or erratic, and fully tapping into Christian McCaffrey‘s dual-threat, being well on pace for becoming the first NFL player with 1000 yards rushing and receiving each in multiple seasons. Overall, San Francisco is now up to fifth in offensive success rate (48.1%) despite all of their receiving options being in and out of the lineup. As they’ve transitioned to being more of a traditional dropback team, how they utilize all five eligibles in the pattern to space out concepts and how they weaponize motions with real purpose in that area, has really helped them navigate being limited personnel-wise and overcome games with multiple turnovers. What’ll be interesting is if those institutional advantages they have can help them overcome some slight talent deficiencies compared to the NFL playoff field, although they may be more equipped than others when they get to face one of their divisional opponents for a third team.

.

# 10. Chicago Bears (9-4)

On one hand, a team that just sat there as the NFC’s number one seed until coming up just short on fourth-and-one at Lambeau Field against their hated rivals may seem to deserve an even higher ranking, but at the same time, cracking the top definitely feels like an accomplishment for this group. More than anything, head coach Ben Johnson has truly changed the culture in Chicago, but you do see his fingerprints all over the offense. There are so many interesting little elements to their run game of showing the threat of misdirection or giving pause to defenders on the second level, but at the heart of it – as Marshawn Lynch would say – they’re going to “run through a motherf\*cker’s face”. Just watch back seventh-round rookie Kyle Monangai meeting Packers linebacker Quay Walker in the hole this past Sunday. They now rank second to only the Rams in rushing success rate (47.0%). As it’s to be expected with so many young targets and Caleb Williams just learning the offense, their pass game isn’t nearly as clean and efficient, but they can hit big plays off play-action, and their young QB can has become an elite sack escape artist, who can find completions or valuable yardage as a scrambler deep into the play-clock. We’ll see if they can carry this through the rest of the season, but the defense has certainly been more takeaway-dependent, as they lead the league with 27 total. They simply can’t provide pressure (with a bottom-six rate currently), and only the Bengals have allowed more plays of 20+ yards (58), but they should at least continue to get back contributors in the back-seven.

.

# 11. Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4) 

Ironically enough, this is exactly where I put the Jags following their 3-1 start, as I liked plenty of elements of what got them there, but also had questions about the long-term viability of how they were operating. A lot of those things still feel similarly, as they followed that up by beating the Chiefs before having a lot of their weaknesses exposed by the Rams in a beatdown across the pond, before collapsing in a Davis Mills-led Texans comeback soon after. Yet, they went on to overwhelm a beat-up Chargers team and just took back control of the AFC South with their win over the Colts, in which we also saw Daniel Jones tear his Achilles. Jacksonville’s run game has been really up-and-down, and clever play-designers can find ways to take advantage of their defensive tendencies, but there’s something on both sides of the ball that makes me feel a lot better about where they stand. After Brian Thomas Jr. seemed to shy away from extending for the ball in traffic early in the year, Trevor Lawrence is now attacking the middle of the field much more frequently with the trade for Jakobi Meyers and Brenton Strange returning from injury. And their defense now feels so much more compact in how they squeeze down passing windows in zone coverage, rather than leaving their DBs on islands, while Devin Lloyd has been a magnet for the field (five interceptions in 11 games), along with he and Foye Oluokun coming downhill against the run. Only the Bears have taken the ball away more often (23).

.

# 12. Los Angeles Chargers (9-4) 

Based on the state of their offense line at this point and how they’ve felt completely outmatched in three of their four losses – to the Commanders(!), Colts and Jaguars – it’s almost unfathomable how they sit here with nine wins. After their 3-0 start, I made a video about how [Justin Herbert had entered the “Giant Robot Fighting arena”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYtQnFnxF1E), which now rings as true as ever, since you’re not even going to need a full hand to count the quarterbacks on the planet who could’ve even allowed them to be competitive this past Monday night, much less win the game. According to Pro Football Focus, Justin Fields is the only quarterback with 200+ dropbacks who’s been pressured at a higher rate than Herbert (42.5%), and those Eagles defenders were in his lap before he could even get to the top of his drops for the majority of that matchup. So I don’t really know how much longer he can hang in there, already with broken fingers, since the Bolts also only rank 25^(th) in rushing success rate (38.9%), but his play extension skills and throws under heat have just been bonkers. Somehow they’re converting third downs at the third-highest rate in the league (47.1%). That’s also where they coincidentally rank defensively in that area (34.4%), as that group just forced five turnovers and gave the ball back to their quarterback enough times. Jesse Minter once again is putting one of the most well-prepared units out there on the field, when you look at how they digest route combinations and put themselves in positions to make plays on the ball. We’ve seen them get pushed around at times in the run game, but they’re willing to make the trade-off of living in soft box counts for not allowing explosives through the air (27 – second-fewest in the league).

.

# 13. Philadelphia Eagles (8-5) 

Well, well, well. Eagles fans wanted to EVISCERATE me when I dared to put the Eagles below the Rams (at number three) in my power rankings following week four, shortly after they won the head-to-head on a walk-off game-winning field goal being blocked. At the time, I thought there were some underlying issues with the offense especially that could come back to bite them, and they’ve now lost three straight. Something similar occurred when I placed Jalen Hurts 16^(th) in my QB rankings as part of the “established veterans” tier. I was wrong with that one – he should’ve been even lower. I know this past Monday Night affair was an outlier, but if the main selling points for Hurts are his turnover avoidance and what he provides as a scrambler, as those are now fading away, what is he really offering at this moment? Sure, he can lay those go balls out in front, and we might be telling a slightly different story if A.J. Brown hauls in one of them that were dropped into the bucket, but this entire offense feels broken. Jalen refused to attempt these tight-window throws against zone coverage previously, their pass concepts are pretty elementary, and while we at least saw some flashes of 2024 Saquon against the Chargers, he still ranks 36^(th) among 47 qualified rushers in expected yards per carry (3.8), according to Next Gen Stats. Vic Fangio and company just nearly killed Justin Herbert with an absurd rate of early pressures, and through having more options of what they can do with that fifth DB on the field, that’s felt like less of a liability through the air. They’re still right on the edge of the top ten in success rate, DVOA and EPA per play overall, but recent trends of being out-leveraged on extra gaps created in the run game are concerning.

.

# 14. Dallas Cowboys (6-6-1) 

It only feels right that the Cowboys rank right behind their NFC East rivals, who seemed like they had the division locked up already a month ago. The big reason that there’s at least a chance that this could still flip is their head-to-head win in Dallas two weeks ago. Their offense has been lighting up the scoreboard pretty much all season. Only the Colts have scored on a higher percentage of their drives (48.6%), with a supercomputer at quarterback, George Pickens outperforming Ceedee Lamb as the team’s top receiver, who gives you a little more outside the numbers, a re-invigorated run game under OC Klayton Adams, and a booming kicker, who makes you a threat to put three points on the board as soon as you cross midfield. With increased rates of play-action and motion at the snap, they’re a much tougher unit to prepare for. However, they’ve also turned the ball over 18 times (tied for sixth-most), and the other side of the ball has largely been ugly. Even with recent improvements thanks to trading for Quinnen Williams and getting a couple of young contributors back from injury, for the season, they still ranked ahead of only the Bengals in defensive DVOA and have allowed opponents to score on the second-highest rate of drives (47.9%). Where they’ve shown massive strides over this past month, coming off their bye week, has been run defense, lowering their success rate allowed by just over 10% (38.2% now). The pairing of Quinnen and Osa Odighizuwa gives them a dangerous interior duo of pass-rushers, but they’re relying on Jadeveon Clowney to clean up quarterbacks getting flushed, and you can certainly attack their linebackers in coverage. That’s how they’re also tied with Cincy for a league-high in third-down conversion rate (47.8%). Funnily enough, they’ve been hurt but also benefited more from penalty yardage for/against them.

.

# 15. Kansas City Chiefs (6-7) 

Right behind the Cowboys is the other participant from last year’s Super Bowl, who those guys have beaten recently. Thanksgiving at Jerry World wasn’t the low point for a KC team that has now lost four of their past five games, when they should’ve been primed for a run over the second half of the schedule following the bye. Where their season probably ended in reality was this past Sunday Night, when the frustrations of a season that seemingly never truly got off the ground boiled over, and Andy Reid got overeager to kick-start the offense by going for it on fourth-and-one from their own 31-yard line. It used to be opponents getting tight and making questionable decisions based on the Chiefs' mystique. Even when it felt like they were the ones dictating terms defensively in the second half of that matchup, with Steve Spagnuolo in assault mode by blitz, and they got a vintage Chris Jones performance, after they had been average on that side of the ball by most metrics, they couldn’t cash on it. What’s crazy about all of this is the fact that on the surface, as you go through their statistical profile, it’s pretty easy to make an argument that they’re actually a little better than last year’s 15-2 team. Even after their 20-10 loss at home to the Texans, they’re just inside the top ten in point differential for the season (+63), and they rank sixth in schedule-adjusted DVOA. The pendulum has truly swung the opposite way, as they’re 1-6 in one-score games, and simply haven’t been able to make the key plays in the biggest moments and come out on top. So if they somehow were to get into the tournament against an AFC field largely lacking (positive) experience in January, they could end up being dangerous, but head-to-head losses to the Jaguars, Bills, Texans and their two AFC West foes, make that nearly impossible.

.

# 16. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-6) 

We’ve reached the NFC South portion of the program and you could easily flip these two teams, if you like. What that decision comes down to is how heavily you weigh recent form versus what they can be at their best. Ultimately, I don’t look at either side being able to a deep playoff push, but there are a few more things I think bank on with the Bucs in that set-up, hosting what probably will be the five-seed – as we’ve seen in the past. The run game hasn’t nearly been as efficient or well-constructed without Liam Coen calling the shots and they’ll need to work Mike Evans back into the offense, yet right now they just feel a little off compared to when they were firing on all cylinders throughout their 5-1 start. Baker putting the ball a tad high and Emeka Egbuka not being able to haul it in for a likely game-winning touchdown on a double move this past Sunday against the Saints best illustrates that. Somewhat quietly, they’ve plummeted to 28^(th) in offensive success rate (42.1%), while Baker has reversed to being more of a net negative as a scrambler. Defensively, I actually really like the cohesiveness this secondary has reached, paired with Vita Vea being a wall in the middle, setting the table for the fourth-best defense in rushing success rate (35.3%). You know you’re getting a bunch of fire zones on early downs trying to push offenses behind the chains and they have guys who can make plays on the ball when they can play with their eyes on it. At the same time, there are some pretty obvious tendencies with how they match personnel, you can find success by putting their linebackers into conflict, and they’ve allowed opponents to turn red zone trips into touchdowns at the third-highest rate (68.8%). They are however tied for the fourth-best turnover differential in the league (+9).

# 17. Carolina Panthers (7-6) 

On the other side of this argument is a Panthers team that has put together the biggest rollercoaster season of anyone in the league, now having alternated between wins and losses these past seven weeks, including no-shows by their offense against the Saints and 49ers, but also two of the most impressive upsets you’re going to find, winning slow-tempo, run-heavy contest at Lambeau Field, but then also out-pacing my number one team in the Rams most recently, fueled by three turnover from their defense to put them over the top. Nobody has oscillated at the same frequency as the team overall as their quarterback Bryce Young. He looks totally uncomfortable one week, but then hangs in the pocket and beats defenses with pin-point throws as the rush is closing in, the next. At their core however, they want to rely on pounding the rock, Dave Canales seems to have a couple of designer plays crafted against their opponents every week, they now have a guy in first-round pick Tetairoa McMillan if they do face man-coverage, and only the Broncos have put together more game-winning drives at the end (five). Although we have seen some improvement from their defense finally under Ejiro Evero, they’re main issue is that they simply can’t get off the field, allowing opponents to convert 46.8% of third and fourth downs combined. Derrick Brown has been tremendous again this season, but they just don’t have anyone they can rely upon off the edge, as they’ve registered the lowest pressure rate in the league (21.6%). Another funny quirk I found in my research is that they’re the only team perfectly balanced with 17 turnovers on offense and defense each, and those have been integral in their success. Thankfully, we’ll get this divisional rivalry twice over the final three weeks.

. 

# 18. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)  

Moving on to our duo of AFC North blue bloods, who just battled it out in Baltimore, in what was one of the uglier iterations even of their storied series. I can see how some Steelers fans can spin this into them being able to make the key plays needed with their backs against the wall coming into that day, and talk themselves into this version of Aaron Rodgers paired with an opportunistic defense. But let me ask you guys this – Are you really satisfied with what you’re currently watching? Even if we accept that some of these questionable calls ultimately even out over the course of a season, and while I still can’t believe the Isaiah Likely touchdown was reversed, I’d argue Pittsburgh was the more deserving side, we have to wonder what the ceiling of this operation looks like. The formula for success is pretty clear with them. Rodgers needs to mix in the occasional vertical shot with all the quick game stuff this offense revolves around, paired with some quick-hitting runs from the shotgun. Meanwhile, they’ve realized that they don’t have the bodies in coverage outside of Joey Porter Jr. to play extensive man-coverage, but rather they need to crowd spaces and force quarterbacks to hold onto the ball, in order for their pass-rush to get home. Only the Bears have forced more turnovers (23), and they’re tied for sixth in total sacks (36). They’re certainly vulnerable on the ground on the edges, as Buffalo illustrated when they rushed for 249 yards just the week prior, while your offense doesn’t counterbalance that with many explosives of their own, as Rodgers is still tied for a league-low 6.4 yards average depth of target.

.

# 19. Baltimore Ravens (6-7) 

Do I feel like Baltimore is still the team with the higher ceiling among these two? And is there a path for them putting together another four-game win streak to end the year, before hosting a home playoff game with momentum? Absolutely. I played around with the playoff predictor a little bit and found that as long as they win the rematch in Pittsburgh, they’d basically have the tie-breaker based on success against common opponents, as long as they otherwise win the same number of games. Having said that, I don’t have any real data points that would suggest we’ll at some point see a version of these Ravens that resembles those from the last couple of years. The fact that they’re tied for second with 5.0 yards per-carry is kind of a lie, as they’ve ripped off the occasional explosive, but they actually rank 22^(nd) in rushing success rate (40.1%). Moreover, the lack of answers with their protection plans, Lamar has looked as skittish inside the pocket as we’ve seen in a while, along with lacking that extra gear when he does escape, and they seem allergic to holding onto the ball as they get to the end zone. Only two offenses have converted red zone drives into touchdowns at a lower rate than them (44.9%). The defensive numbers are kind of skewed by the various injuries they dealt with prior to pulling themselves out of that 1-5 hole, but they simply can’t get to the quarterback with just four rushers, as only the 49ers and Panthers have recorded fewer sacks (19). For as much as they were able to hold down bad offenses from scoring points for a while, we’ve now seen what Joe Burrow and Aaron Rodgers are capable of against them when they never truly feel uncomfortable.

.

# 20. Miami Dolphins (6-7) 

The fact that the Dolphins now sit here with the same record as AFC titans like the Chiefs and Ravens, considering how their season started, feels absolutely. They were 1-6 at one point. The Browns defense absolutely destroyed them at the end of that stretch, and even after a shocking 34-10 win over the Falcons at the time, they were quickly brought back down to earth by the Ravens the following Thursday Night, to where many were just waiting for news on Mike McDaniel getting fired potentially the next day. Instead, they moved on from GM Chris Grier, and they’ve now won four straight, and have a sliver of hope for a Wildcard berth at least. The key to their turnaround has been the fact that they’ve gone away from being this high-flying passing attack and turning into one of the premier running teams. Right now, they rank behind only the Rams and Colts in rush EPA (0.025), as Devon Achane is averaging 5.8 yards per carry and no other team has ripped off more explosives on the ground (14). On the flipside, they’ve defended the run at a higher level, with growth from their pair of rookie D-tackles and just allowing their linebackers to attack the backfield. Since they now push opponents into more defined passing situations, DC Anthony Weaver can really shine with various pressure looks and forcing quarterbacks to re-configure what’s happening coverage-wise post-snap. That’s set the table for logging ten takeaways combined over this four-game win streak, and Rasul Douglas has at least solidified one of those corner spots that killed them earlier in the year.

.

# 21. Indianapolis Colts (8-5) 

All I can say here is this – I’m sorry, Colts fans. Although they had to go to overtime for it, they must’ve felt great flying back from Germany after their win over the Falcons, to put them at 8-2 and all but wrap up the AFC South crown. Since the bye week that followed, the lost in heartbreaking fashion at Kansas City in OT, an All-Pro corner in Sauce Gardner, who they had just traded two first-round picks for, suffered a calf strain a couple of snaps into the Texans game, and this past Sunday at Jacksonville – their house of horrors – Daniel Jones tore his Achilles, before the Jags pulled away from them and took control of the division race. By giving up that draft capital, they pretty much took themselves out of the rookie quarterback market these next two years and locked themselves into the veteran, who they’re hoping will be close to 100% again when 2026 kicks off. I was dubious about the move at the time, with the logic of adding a true difference-maker at a position of need for a team with realistic Super Bowl aspirations in a watered-down AFC. Even now, this is still the number four team in total DVOA for the season, which generally weighs offense more heavily. They also remain as the lone team to score on over half of their drives (51.2%), and only the Lions have a higher yards-per-play average (6.1) than what Shane Steichen has orchestrated. We still needed to see the defense come together with Sauce and Charvarius Ward on the outside, but only the Broncos have surrendered a lower yards-per-carry average (3.8 YPC), Laiatu Latu had emerged as a problem off the edge, and DC Lou Anarumo does have the capacity to put together one-off gameplans to challenge elite quarterbacks.

.

# 22. Cincinnati Bengals (4-9) 

When looking at the standings, you see that the Bengals don’t have that “e” (for eliminated) next to their names quite yet, but giving away that Bills game this past Sunday probably sealed their fate. Once again, they were already in field goal range up by three prior to that game-changing pick-six by Christian Benford. They were at the brink of winning back-to-back contests at Baltimore and Buffalo, while the Ravens and Steelers were involved in a slopfest for who would take control of the AFC North, almost by default. Considering the run they went on last year, rattling off five straight wins, but not getting help from others on the final Sunday of the season, now Joe Burrow coming back from his turf toe injury and performing as well up to that point, this has to be highly disappointing. Having said that, the defense is still a complete mess. They rank dead-last in defensive DVOA, they’ve given up an NFL-high 63(!) plays of 20+ yards, and they’re allowing 2.1 points more per game than any other team in the league (31.8 PPG). Not having the one impact player from 2024 in Trey Hendrickson has certainly been felt, but this is what it really comes down to – Cincy has created the fewest tackles for loss (40), while according to [pro-football-reference.com](http://pro-football-reference.com), they’ve missed 143 attempted stops – no other team has more than 107.

Hey there denizens of r/EDH

This community has been pretty awesome and I wanted to give something back, so I've put together a deck with one of my favorite commanders at the helm, \[\[Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant\]\], a creature so terrifying that even the Phyrexians decided ""You know what? Perhaps not ***ALL*** will be one...""

[The list is here](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/_nAwqyLJoEWxy6zy62Ej4A) and will remain public along with [the primer](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/_nAwqyLJoEWxy6zy62Ej4A/primer).  Even after this giveaway has closed, you can still playtest the deck and read the primer as much as you like.

And [here is an album showing the actual, physical cards](https://imgur.com/a/MLE8jCX) you will be receiving if you win.  Deck box and sleeves will be included.

I can also swap all of the basic mountains to the Phyrexia All Will Be One full art mountains at the winner's request.

&amp;#x200B;

# CHOOSING A WINNER

Exactly 24 hours after this post goes live, I will run the program to select a winner.  I will then reply to that commenter, send them a message via Reddit and finally a Reddit chat.

That's 3 different ways of getting in touch.  If you do not respond within 24 hours to claim the deck, then I will re-run the program and select a new winner, and attempt the same methods of communication until a winner replies and claims their prize.  After which I will update the post and close the giveaway.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, now onto the primer for this deck!  Even if you don't win it, I highly encourage you to give Chiss-Goria a try.  This particular build was on a $125 budget and it can go toe-to-toe with considerably more expensive decks.  It's fast, it's explosive and it has a pretty big ceiling to upgrade.  Let's get into it.

&amp;#x200B;

# INTRODUCTION

Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant is one of the oldest and most ferocious dragons from the original plane of Mirrodin. It has not taken kindly to the New Phyrexian invaders and does not discriminate in scorching flesh and metal alike. It has avoided phyresis by simply annihilating any Phyrexian that dares to have the audacity to exist in its general vicinity. While not explicitly an ally to the Mirran resistance, the rebels give it a wide berth as it cuts a fiery swathe through the Phyrexian forces and use its discarded scales and teeth to create nigh-indestructible weapons.

Chiss-Goria's penchant for all things metal is represented by its Affinity for artifacts, which this deck is built to take advantage of.

We're playing lots of cheap artifact mana that serves dual purpose of reducing Chiss's casting cost AND providing the remaining mana needed to get the big dragon into play. Once it's on the field, it can swing immediately thanks to Haste and when it does, it can exile the top 5 cards of our library and we have until the end of turn to cast an artifact from among them. The neat part is that it too gains Affinity for artifacts. If we have enough mana or just enough artifacts on the field, we can cast some absolute bombs for dirt cheap or even for free.

This built-in cost reduction also helps offset commander tax in case our fiery forge tyrant gets removed, so getting it back onto the field to terrorize our opponents becomes a trivial matter.

You'll notice we're running a lower amount of interaction than most decks would, but once you start playing the deck you'll realize very quickly that we do not care what our opponents are doing once we've cheated into play some of the strongest, most devastating artifacts in the game. We don't want to compromise our gameplan with burn spells that may or may not be useful. No, we're looking to get Chiss-Goria into play ASAP and then get those big bomb artifacts into play not long after.

&amp;#x200B;

# PROS, CONS &amp; POWER LEVEL

**Pros**

* This is one of the fastest decks I've ever built and the sheer card advantage that Chiss-Goria generates is insane, since each attack essentially gives us a mini hand of 5 cards to choose from.
* Chiss's ability triggers upon attack. Not dealing damage, not an activation cost, just an attack. With Haste, this is incredibly simple to pull off and get the advantage train rolling.
* Being mono-color and having very few search effects, we won't have to shuffle very much and our turns will be fairly quick.
* Chiss getting removed barely affects us, since Affinity will basically cancel out any commander tax if we have a bunch of artifacts in play.

**Cons**

* We may become archenemy very quickly, especially if we drop a scary artifact early, such as on turn 5. Don't get salty when targeted for attacks.
* This deck gets severely slowed down by things like Collector Ouphe. It's not completely dead in the water since Chiss doesn't care about those effects and we can still cast artifacts, we just can't activate their abilities. However static abilities still work despite Ouphe.
* This deck runs a low number of creatures and most of them are dorks so we may not have blockers in the early game. After turn 6 or so, we should have enough artifacts that Affinity will be all the cost reduction we need to cast spells with Chiss-Goria's trigger so we can start leaving our mana dorks untapped to block with. And eventually when we find Wurmcoil Engine, it will help us stabilize with Lifelink.

**Power Level**

* This is a high-power casual deck. Basically on the strong side of non-cEDH decks.
* It starts ""doing its thing"" by around turn 5 or 6 and can be in a ""I will pretty much win"" position by turn 8.
* It does not have combos. It is more voltron-focused than general artifacts so once Chiss has been suited up with enough equipment, we can take out a player pretty much every turn.

&amp;#x200B;

# THE GAMEPLAN

In your opening hand, you want to look for mana rocks and mana dorks. If you don't have anything to cast by turn 3 at the latest, mulligan that hand. We can't afford to be slow out of the gate.

Ramp as fast as possible. This deck is packed full of mana dorks and mana rocks, all of which are artifacts. These not only make Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant cheaper to cast out of the command zone, but can also provide the mana needed to pay for the rest of its cost.

If you have any protection pieces like Swiftfoot Boots, get those into play before casting the big dragon so you can equip them right away. Keeping Chiss on the field is essential to pushing your advantage with this deck.

Once Chiss-Goria is in play, it can swing immediately thanks to haste. Consider how many artifacts you have in play and how much mana you have available and ask yourself if you can feasibly cast an artifact if you exile one off the top 5 cards. Maybe the first time you cast Chiss-Goria, the answer might be ""no"" but every time afterwards you should just go for it. This is a red deck built around chaos, it pays to be chaotic.

On the turn you cast Chiss-Goria you'll likely have tapped out to do so, but when you next untap with the Mirran dragon, I would recommend you hold up all available mana in your pre-combat main phase so you can spend it on an absolute bomb artifact from the top 5 cards exiled with Chiss-Goria's attack trigger. I pretty much do this every turn I have Chiss ready to attack. The only exception would be if you have a valuable protection piece in-hand like Hammer of Nazahn or Mask of Avacyn and the mana to hard cast and equip it. Otherwise, save your mana until after Chiss has attacked.

Begin cheating massive, powerful artifacts into play and start oppressing opponents. Strionic Resonator and Lithoform Engine can copy Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant's ability when it attacks so we can get another group of 5 cards exiled and choose another artifact from among them to cast with Affinity.

Focus down the most threatening player first and foremost. Don't be nice! You're going to be archenemy so even the odds as quickly as possible. If Chiss-Goria is suited up with enough equipment, it can threaten a K.O. from Commander Damage easily. Embercleave is particularly terrifying, as it can be attached to Chiss-Goria before it deals damage, making it a 6/5 with double strike so connecting once will deal 12 commander damage to that opponent, meaning another attack will take them out of the game.

I would also highly recommend that you use the Playtest feature on Moxfield to goldfish the deck.  It's one thing to read a guide but another entirely to actually go through the motions.  You seriously need to feel just how fast it is and how quickly things get out of hand when you swing with Chiss.

&amp;#x200B;

# AFFINITY, KICKER &amp; TREASURE RULINGS

**This is very important to know for piloting this deck effectively:**

When casting a spell with Affinity for Artifacts, you count the number of artifacts you control (including treasures), do the math and then declare the cost of the spell on the stack.

At this point, you can now sacrifice treasures, tap rocks, dorks and lands to generate mana and use it to pay the DISCOUNTED cost that you declared beforehand. In other words, you get to have your cake and eat it too. The mana cost is determined before the treasures need to be sacrificed, but once it is determined, you can can pay however you like and the cost of the spell will not change (even as you sac your treasures).

Remember this when you have treasures and want to cast Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant or any artifacts exiled by its ability.

Along these lines, Kicker costs such as the one in Skyclave Relic can be added onto the original spell cost BEFORE taking Affinity into account, so if we want to cast Skyclave Relic with Affinity from Chiss-Goria's ability, we can take into account any 6 artifacts on our field and cast the Skyclave Relic for free AND with its Kicker cost fully paid!

**Let's run through a quick example to make sure you're understanding the sequence of cost determination and payment:**

* You have Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant, Foundry Inspector, Mind Stone and Sol Ring in play untapped. All of your other mana sources are tapped/unavailable.
* An opponent has Thalia, Guardian of Thraben in play.
* You attack with Chiss-Goria and exile your top 5 cards. One of them is Skyclave Relic.

**Question:**

* Can you cast Skyclave Relic kicked? If so, how much mana do you spend?

**Answer:**

&gt;!Yes you can. Skyclave Relic would normally cost 6 to cast kicked, but it has Affinity. We have 3 artifacts in play, another 1 discount from Foundry Inspector but another 1 tax from Thalia, so 6 - 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 (this is the final cost locked in). We can tap Sol Ring and Mind Stone to pay for it.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

# PACKAGES

**Ramp &amp; Cost Reduction (31)**

* Hedron Crawler, Iron Myr, Manakin, Ornithopter of Paradise, Plague Myr, Alloy Myr, Palladium Myr, Everflowing Chalice, Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, Fellwar Stone, Fire Diamond, Liquimetal Torque, Mind Stone, Prismatic Lens, Skyclave Relic, Fractured Powerstone and Worn Powerstone all produce mana on their own. Some of these, such as Thought Vessel and Fractured Powerstone have pointless secondary effects which we don't care about. We're running them because they are the most efficient, low-cost mana rocks on a budget.
* Caged Sun increases the red mana produced by our lands.
* Burnished Hart and Solemn Simulacrum get lands out of our deck and onto the field.
* Foundry Inspector, Jhoira's Familiar, Cloud Key and Semblance Anvil all reduce the cost of our spells. It should be noted that the ideal card to exile with Semblance Anvil would be an Artifact Creature; this way both our creature cards AND artifact cards benefit from the cost reduction.
* Strike it Rich, Seize the Spoils, Big Score, Unexpected Windfall and Prized Statue all create Treasure tokens which reduce the cost of Chiss-Goria and can be sacrificed for mana.
* Cityscape Leveler can be used to destroy one of our own permanents if we're desperate for some Powerstone mana.

While the above cards explicitly function as ramp, it should be noted that any artifact sitting on our field technically counts as ramp in this deck due to Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant having Affinity, therefore all of our artifacts do indeed reduce its casting cost even if they don't actually make mana on their own.

&amp;#x200B;

**Removal &amp; Interaction (9)**

* Duplicant can exile a creature when it ETBs.
* Meteor Golem can destroy any permanent when it ETBs.
* Steel Hellkite can destroy certain permanents depending on how much mana we sink into its ability.
* Cityscape Leveler can destroy a permanent when we cast it and whenever it attacks.
* Chaos Warp can get rid of any permanent.
* Abrade and Galvanic Blast can deal damage to creatures.
* Bolt Bend can redirect a spell on the stack.
* Soul of New Phyrexia has an ability that can grant our board indestructible at instant-speed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Card Draw &amp; Card Advantage (7)**

* Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant is our main source of card advantage since it can essentially let us cast an artifact from among the top 5 cards of our deck for cheap or even free. We'll be triggering this a lot while playing this deck.
* Solemn Simulacrum can draw us a card when it dies.
* Endless Atlas can draw us a card if we have at least 3 Mountains.
* Mind Stone can be sacrificed to draw a card.
* Mystic Forge lets us cast artifacts from the top of our library which functionally serves as card advantage. We can also use this at instant speed to get rid of the top card if we don't want to draw it or don't want it in our pile of 5 when we attack with Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant.
* Breya's Apprentice lets us sac an artifact on our field to exile the top card of our library and cast it if we want to, functionally serving as card advantage. This is also a useful way to get artifacts into the graveyard such as Prized Statue or Hangarback Walker and reap their respective benefits.
* Daretti, Scrap Savant can draw us cards but also makes us discard the same amount so it's not card advantage but it does help us dig through our deck if we have too many dead cards in hand.

&amp;#x200B;

**Recursion (5)**

* Daretti, Scrap Savant, Goblin Engineer and Trash for Treasure let us exchange artifacts on the field to return artifacts from our graveyard.
* Myr Retriever and Scrap Trawler can retrieve artifacts when they die.

&amp;#x200B;

**Equipment**

Wanted to quickly go over the equipment in this deck since we're leaning slightly into a voltron-esque build.

* Hammer of Nazahn is arguably our best equipment and the only truly expensive card in the deck. I set aside almost a quarter of the deck's budget because it really is that good. It attaches itself to Chiss-Goria immediately upon entering the field and then can immediately equip any other equipment when it enters as well. An indestructible Chiss is a happy Chiss.
* Mask of Avacyn, just a quick and easy way to grant Chiss-Goria Hexproof so it can no longer be targeted by opponents' cards.
* Swiftfoot Boots, a backup Mask of Avacyn for all intents and purposes. If we already have the mask on Chiss, we can put the Boots on another creature, no big deal.
* Nettlecyst is incredible in this deck since it provides +1/+1 for each artifact we control, and I don't know if you've noticed but we have quite a few of those. This can easily boost Chiss to over 10 power, meaning two attacks are enough to take a player out of the game with commander damage (or just one attack with double strike).
* Hexplate Wallbreaker allows the wielder to force another combat phase, which is insanely good for Chiss-Goria since it exiles 5 cards upon attacking, meaning a second combat lets us get another group of 5 to choose from, similar to why we're running Strionic Resonator and Lithoform Engine.
* Embercleave is amazing in this deck. If we exile it with Chiss's trigger, we can cast it with Flash and attach it to Chiss before it even deals damage. It'll become a 6/5 with double strike so it deals 12 damage to the opponent, meaning a second attack will take them out of the game.
* Lizard Blades is normally a creature but can reconfigure and attach itself to Chiss and grant it Double Strike.

&amp;#x200B;

# UPGRADE PATH

If you'd like to see my take on a powered up list, [I have it here](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/VTVVTgDP3kOSWsZH3Zmd0Q/primer). It's my current Chiss build and I'm loving it. It's a good list to aim for if you decide to build the budget version here and upgrade over time.

The nice thing about Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant is that it is incredibly customizable. The only truly essential cards I would say are the cheap, early-game mana dorks and mana rocks (things like Iron Myr, Mind Stone, etc.). You need a critical mass of those so you have something to do in the early game while reducing Chiss's formidable 9-mana cost down to reasonable amount.  
  
Keep those cards in the deck and you'll consistently get Chiss on board around turn 4 or 5 at the latest.  
  
The rest of the ""big, fun artifacts"" package is entirely up to you. As you upgrade over time and your budget expands, test and see what you like before buying. Darksteel Forge, Mycosynth Lattice, Portal to Phyrexia and Blightsteel Colossus are all fun options. If your budget really expands or if you don't mind proxies, then things like Mana Vault, Mana Crypt, Mox Opal, etc. will really speed this deck up.  
  
I would also highly recommend replacing Mask of Avacyn at some point with any one of Lightning Greaves, Champion's Helm or Commander's Plate. While they are not necessarily better protection equipment, they are cheaper to equip which does make a difference.  
  
You could even lean more heavily into Voltron if you'd like and include some of the dual swords like Sword of Feast and Famine. Just be careful if you choose to include swords that provide protection from red (such as Sword of War and Peace) because these will force your red equipment like Embercleave to fall off.

post,"We need to re-think ""speeding"" and speed limits",2025-06-23 02:53:02,"I'm concerned that speed limits in most places of the U.S. have lost their purpose as they have failed to accurately convey the maximum speed to travel before safety consequences start.

1. Many states have speed limit caps, where, even if engineering studies justify placing higher speed limits to match the natural flow of traffic on wide open freeways, speeds higher than 55, 65, or 70... (depending on state) are still not allowed to be posted *even* when the prevailing speed is closer to 80. Mind you that these are FREEWAYS, where we are not worried about cross traffic nor head-on collisions. Here is where speeding becomes commonplace and ""acceptable.""
2. I'm worried that when speeding is ""acceptable,"" drivers feel OK about driving 5 to 10 mph over the speed limit on city streets where safety is critical. The most extreme examples I see are drivers going 30 in a 20 mph school zone with kids crossing the street. The 20 mph limit is there to reduce the harm  the child in case they do get hit, and to increase margins to allow drivers to avoid hitting the child. If 80 is ok in a 70, I can see some drivers thinking that 30 mph in front of a school yard 20 mph zone is OK.

In addition, some DOTs are still relying on the 85th percentile rule to set speed limits around town without accounting for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. We know that many drivers have the tendency to go too fast around people walking on the street, meaning that these ""voted in"" speed limits tend to lean on the high side. Did you know that NY State DID NOT ALLOW speed zones &lt;25 mph until 2024?

In summary, raise/eliminate speed limit caps on highways and allow flexibility for putting low speed limits around town. Make sure speed limits reflect the actual dangers present to drivers and other road users. Then, we can start talking about things like speed cameras.

Edit: Clarified that the 20 mph *reduces potential harm* to children, rather than ""protecting"" them",597,https://www.reddit.com/r/driving/comments/1li3idh/we_need_to_rethink_speeding_and_speed_limits/,low-traffic zones,

Speed limits matter significantly more at slower speeds. Always respect the school zone, but a straight shot on empty roads for miles? Meh

**The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. Grand Concourse Terminal. Local Time: 0620 Hours.**

**Emma**

Teleportation via convoluted and magical means was not beyond me.

I’d experienced way, *way* more than my fair share of it in my first week of being here.

But portals? A literal *bridge* between two points in space? Where all it took was a simple step to bridge the gap between tens of miles, as if it was just separated by the thickness of a doorframe?

Now, *that* was markedly different.

Or at the very least, it *felt* different.

Whether it was simply because I was now face to face with a portal without the added pressure of a bomb ticking down to oblivion, or whether it was because I wasn’t still reeling from the explosive repercussions of said bomb, one fact remained the same — looking through that door was quite literally breaking both my mind and my sense of perspective.

This was amplified even further, the moment Ilunor stepped through that door, and arrived in a space that was effectively an entire cable-car ride away.

He’d just traveled *miles*… in a *single step*.

I could feel the spirits of Professor Doctor Fujikawa, Professor Doctor Khan, and Associate Professor Shaw, bearing down on me with varying levels of satisfaction, frustration, and self-congratulatory ovations in that order.

Their life’s work, having been relegated to the footnotes of the many, *many*, failed attempts at getting us out of Sol before the warp drive, was now being proven at least *somewhat* tenable here in an entirely different reality.

Whilst not *exactly* a wormhole… this most certainly felt as mind-breaky as one, that’s for sure.

“**Ahem!**” A voice from behind me finally snapped me out of my shock and reverie, as I turned around to see the apprentice. “Gawking at the fixed-point portal between the Academy and the town now, are ya?!” He cocked his head. “What?! Haven’t you ever seen the groundbreaking, reality-defining, earth-shattering wonder of instantaneous transport between two points in a physically discrete space before?!” The man paused, managing to just about close the distance between us, leaving an uncomfortable two inches of space between our personal spaces.

“I mean, I have, but, I guess this one’s just… *different*.” I offered.

To which the man simply let out a loud *hmph*, before responding. “Very well then!” He shouted, loud enough that I feared for anyone still sleeping within a hundred mile radius, before reaching into his coat and producing a letter. “**Here**, take *this*.” He pushed the letter right in front of my face, prompting me to grab it, a groan escaping my throat the moment I saw who it was from.

*The Dean.*

“Is that all?” I replied with a sigh.

“That is, in fact, *all*.” The apprentice nodded, and with a single flourish of his cape, he began strutting back over to his ticketing booth with a few stompy footfalls.

With another frustrated sigh, I began tearing into the letter, revealing a rather short one this time around, with a particularly curious instruction that felt innocuous as it did… dare I say it — *magical*.

*In accordance with Academy regulation, given you are classified as an atypical mana-fielder, you are instructed to purchase an Mana Focus from any of the approved proprietors within the Crown Herald Town of Elaseer. Attached to this letter is a list of approved…*

The benign wording, and the lack of any passive aggressive jabs (barring the whole atypical mana-fielder thing), felt like it was setting the tone for the day.

Hopefully, Thalmin’s hopes would come to fruition.

Hopefully… Today *would* actually be uneventful.

The fact that the dean was being civil and upfront for once, was a good of an indicator as any, right?

In any case, I eventually turned my attention back towards the door, as I resumed my stares of complete and utter disbelief at the magical wonder in front of me; more specifically, at the horizon line that was entirely *off* from my perspective.

With the strangely overcast night behind us, we were promptly treated to the sight of a pale blue sky, barely lit up by the sun; giving an almost whimsical feeling to the start of the day.

It was that same feeling I got when waking up *extra* early at the start to a long weekend. That feeling of being *free* to do whatever it was I wanted, and the large and seemingly endless possibilities that awaited me at the dawn of a new day.

But instead of just waiting for another episode of *Forgotten Tales* to drop, or diving head first (then promptly getting lost) into the seemingly endless physical library in my dad’s study, I was instead faced with the boundless and practically infinite possibilities that awaited me in Elaseer.

This was a magical town.

In a genuinely magical reality.

And sure, if I were to be *cynical* about it, I *could* say it was a *college town*, and a pretty gentrified one at that.

But that didn’t mean the *spark* of honest to god *fantasy* wasn’t still there *somewhere*.

A town was, after all, composed of *people*.

And if the Academy had taught me anything, it’s that even in a sea of brainwashed subjects, there were always those that didn’t conform.

So if Thacea, Thalmin, Sorecar and Chiska were anything to go by, the town could very well be my closest shot at fulfilling this *‘fantastical world’ itch*.

“EVI.” I began, eliciting an affirmative beep from my virtual partner in crime. “Keep a close eye on telemetry readings, and whatever you do, don’t freak out.” I warned playfully, before going through the motions of what literally any other person would do in my shoes.

I began testing out the portal.

With a tentative, but curious motion, I pushed my ‘hand’ through the threshold.

I expected something to immediately throw me off.

Some sort of resistance, some sort of barrier, some weird surge in energy, some sort of *suction* pulling me through the threshold.

Instead, I felt nothing.

There was no resistance.

No barrier.

No weird eruption of energy or anything to indicate anything was amiss.

Not even a weird ‘suction’ to push me through the threshold.

Nothing, but a heavy dose of mana radiation that increased in intensity at the threshold of the portal, presumably there just to *sustain* it.

I stood there, my body firmly stood within the Academy, and my ‘hand’ inches in front of me… miles away in town.

A familiar feeling I thought I’d be experiencing *more* of on this mission quickly manifested — the feeling of complete and utter befuddlement, disorientation, and outright disbelief.

I was seeing what was only possible in VR, manifesting in *real life*.

And it was *just so jarring*.

“Ugh! Enough with the childish theatrics, earthrealmer!” I heard a voice from across the doorway, Ilunor’s voice, coming through.

What happened next however just put my brain into a further spiral, as he casually walked through the portal once more, from the town, and back into the Academy; where he promptly placed himself behind one of my shins and started pushing.

The act itself was comical, if not downright aggravating, depending on my mood.

However, given the context of *how* this was even allowed to happen… it didn’t really bother me. Moreover, it simply pushed me to investigate the portal further.

Ignoring the Vunerian, and focusing entirely on the doorway in front of me, I finally moved forward, taking a single, solid stride and reaching the other side in the same way my ‘hand’ did — without any fanfare whatsoever.

“I assume you lack such forms of instantaneous transportation in your realm, Emma.” Thacea surmised.

However, instead of responding, I simply moved *back* towards the portal, now utterly *obsessed* over it.

I did what anyone would do, be they a child or adult, gamer or scientist…

Indeed, I channeled the sum total of human curiosity to satiate that one burning question.

What *would* happen if you stood in the *middle* of the portal? What would your eyes see when you were wedged halfway between two spaces?

*I just had to find out.*

So with another swift motion, I once again stepped through the portal. However this time, I stopped half way, standing sideways in the door, with one foot in the Academy and the other in Elaseer. This way, both of my eyes now stared out at two different locations, miles apart.

But again, just like the ‘hand’ experiment, nothing disastrous happened.

Instead, I experienced more or less the same thing you’d experience in a typical VR session if you attempted the same stunt.

I simply saw the Academy’s concourse in one eye, and Elaseer’s in the other.

If anything, because of how similar the terminals’ designs were, this proved to be less disorientating than I expected.

In fact, if I didn’t realize this doorway was a portal, it’d be difficult to tell I was in two places at once.

The thought of the portal slicing me in half through an unexpected deactivation made me anxiously jump to the other side however, as I was soon confronted with the gang who stared at me with varying degrees of perplexity.

“You know, they designed the concourse in such a way, with virtually identical designs, such that a person wouldn’t lose their sanity if they pulled off the stunt you just did.” Thalmin announced firmly, garnering a cock of my head.

“Really?”

“No, not really.” He responded with a mischievous chuckle, his features contorting to one of absolute slyness that I could only respond to with a puff of my cheeks… not that anyone was able to see it. “But it’s fun to imagine that to be the case, regardless!”

“In any case, given everything you’ve experienced thus far, I’d assume you’ve had *enough* of portals for the rest of the school year, earthrealmer.” Ilunor butted in with a frustrated groan.

“I mean, to an extent, yeah. However, *those* experiences were more or less ‘heat of the moment’  type situations. In total, I think I’ve had what… three encounters with portals overall? *This* is the first time I actually get to mess around with a portal, and it’s just so… *jarring*.” I explained, garnering only a quirk of Ilunor’s brow, but more so just a face full of tired frustration.

“You newrealmers are so easily amused by the slightest of modern conveniences.” He shot back, as he began walking out of the concourse, followed by a growling Thalmin, and eventually by myself and Thacea.

We eventually made our way through the mirrored concourse, towards the open-air entrance, where I was finally able to lay my eyes upon an entirely new world.

A world that I’d only briefly glimpsed during a dark and action-filled night.

But one that now showed its true colors, bathed in sunlight, rather than by the occasional streetlamp.

The first thing that hit me was the brightness of it all, as even in the drowsy shades of dawn, the buildings themselves seemed to *glow* with a warm and welcoming aura. The architecture on display here was nothing short of *artisanal* in terms of aesthetic, but uniform in their theming.

They resembled something out of the renaissance, with townhouses and free-standing structures lining the wide avenue-like streets. However, what they prided themselves in intricate design, they seemed to lack in color and paintwork, as cleanliness didn’t seem to end with the spotlessness of the streets and facades, but seemed to go so far as to suck the life out of the buildings — leaving only white and varying shades of cream and black to act as accenting and contrast.

But in a story as old as time, wherever there was an arbitrary deficit in expression, there was bound to be some sort of an outlet to make up for it. Which, in the case of Elaseer, seemed to come in the form of the outrageously ornate architecture of the buildings themselves. Block upon block of storefront and apartment alike were decorated in all manner of facades, ranging from ornate carvings, to terraced exteriors, to even full-blown statues and ornaments of varying size and shapes. Nothing seemed to be off-limits here, as it looked as if the architects had just raided an antique store for all of its knick-knacks for use in their designs.

The second thing to really slam me in the face was the sheer *openness* and *liveliness* of the streets themselves.

As unlike the repetitive and same-y life within the academy walls, there seemed to be more *variety*, more *color* when it came to passersby and traffic alike. With the sound of quiet conversation and occasional chatter generating this buzzing sensation within my very soul.

Whilst small town life was one I yearned for, I never knew what I missed when I left Acela for the relative sterility of the IAS’ facility, let alone the quiet *emptiness* that was the Academy.

And while Elaseer was no Acela, let alone this early in the morning, it was still a welcome departure from the predatory school life that was the Academy.

Elves dominated what few pedestrians there were at this hour, with most dressed rather modestly, lacking in ornamentation and gaudy aesthetics that the rest of the non-uniformed student body seemed to be so fond of. And judging by their neutral expressions, and a look of deference upon making eye contact with *Ilunor*, and to a lesser extent, Thacea and Thalmin, it soon became clear who most of these people were.

Class differences aside, many of them seemed to actually wear a genuine smile on their faces, making for a stark difference from the more calculated interactions back in the Academy. Though strangely, when attempting to isolate and translate their idle chatter, the EVI seemed to come up with a statistically significant wider margin of error; far more than what was observed up too this point.

I was so preoccupied by both the *charm* of my surroundings and the EVI’s technical hiccups, that I’d almost zoned out Thacea’s list-reading, as she went down the list of places we had to hit either before or after the adventuring hall meeting, depending on what shops decided to open.

“Stationeries.” She began, as she went down the list of *precisely* what we needed. “Notebooks, quills, pens, and all manner of instruments.”

“Got it.” I nodded, my mind wandering some more as I just couldn’t stop *looking* at everything around me.

The streets themselves were *buzzing* with vehicular activity, with nary a horse-drawn carriage to be seen, replaced instead by the same sorts of *horseless carriages* similar to Lartia’s own stretch-carriage. Though fancy and relatively common, it seems as if the horseless carriages were mostly relegated for passenger-use, leaving the few utility and cargo-carrying carts I could see to remain mostly horse-drawn. This divide was further reflected in the many alleyways seemingly carved into this picturesque, dynamic world of solid white buildings, as cart upon cart hugged the ‘service channels’ of the avenue, before veering off into an alleyway as quickly as they found one.

“Alchemized and magic-resistant glassware.” Thacea continued, eliciting another nod from me.

“Gotcha.” I responded.

“Though tantalizing, I do urge everyone to resist the temptations of the merchants, as they will do everything in their power to upsell you on superfluous additions on each and every purchase.” Thalmin quickly chimed in.

“*Engraved* glassware, *engraved* stationeries, *engraved* notebooks,. Yes yes yes, these merchants all know one trick in the book, and that’s to play the role of the would-be novice engraver — scrawling down family crests and surnames into each and every item you decide to purchase.” Ilunor responded with a tacit sigh. “*Very poorly too,* if that must be said.” He quickly added.

“Huh… so this really *is* a college town, complete with gimmicks and cringy up-selling tactics.” I offered out absentmindedly, my eyes still transfixed on each and every detail in front of me, as I soaked in the ambiance some more, especially as the sleepy dawn quickly started giving way to all-out morning.

“School uniforms for those that haven’t yet had one tailored—” Thacea paused, taking a moment to purposefully eye each and every one of us. “—of which it seems as if only *one* among us has had the foresight to prepare for.”

My brow quickly perked up at this rare instance of cattiness from the avinor princess.

“Your kind are quick to show your deference for the Nexus, Princess Dilani, and I very much appreciate that.” Ilunor responded with a series of exaggerated nods. “In any case, I will actively mourn the loss of my daily dress. Oh, the sacrifices I make for *academia*.” He spoke in an almost *flighty* tone of voice, as his personality seemed to shift towards this more outwardly eccentric one the more and more we encountered members of the general public.

Many of whom I noticed paying increasing attention to us, their eyes fixated on me in a mix of curiosity and apprehension.

That much was to be expected.

Though what *wasn’t* expected was how about *half* of their attentions seemed to be focused on the Vunerian, as it seemed as if every other person we passed took their time to regard the small blue thing either with a dip of their head, or an all out *bow* provided they weren’t busy with anything on hand.

These public displays of deference seemed to fuel the Vunerian’s gait, as confidence slowly but surely started to return. What damage the Academy life had inflicted on him so far seemed to just melt away with each and every passing show of respect.

This all culminated in the *ultimate* show of courtesy and reverence for the Vunerian as we arrived at our first destination and the reason we even bothered to wake up this early for in the first place — the bakery.

In fact, we didn’t even have to step *into* the establishment for this display of respect to begin.

“Ah! My lord! Please, allow me!” What I’d first assumed to be another customer given his fancy attire, but quickly turned out to be the *doorman*, spoke.

*A bakery… with a literal porter out in front… Now I’ve seen everything*. I thought to myself.

Ilunor’s reaction to this was nothing less than complete and utter satisfaction, as that smug signature grin returned in full.

No further words were exchanged as he waltzed through that door, and into what I could only describe as a bakery that even Marie Antoinette would be impressed by.

Color, vibrancy, and *noisy* design practically flash-banged me, as it felt as if all of the lost vibrancy of the outside world had instead been bottled up and hidden away in this one room. The wallpaper and embellishments of the place *screamed* Versailles, but the glass display cases and gravity-defying rotating shelves of pastries was enough to remind me of exactly where I was.

Pastries of all varieties sat proudly behind each display case, their freshness visible from the fogginess of the glass, and the literal magical *glistening* of some of the more *fancy* treats. Golden brown, flaky, crunchy delights teased me as I became even more palpably aware of the two senses permanently denied to me in this realm. Coincidentally, the two that were arguably the most important in place like this — taste and smell. The former, I could barely deal with. But the latter? Well… that was abject *torture* right about now.

“Ah! My lord! It is an honor to have you as our first customer!” A voice boomed from behind the seemingly unending rows of busy bakers running to and fro the massive furnaces and the display cases out in front. “Welcome to Byron’s Best Baked Goods! It is not often that we are visited by a member of the Nexian nobility. So please, excuse me for my tardiness and lack of tact, my lord.” The proprietor in question, an elf clad in what I could only describe as a cross between a chef’s jacket and a nobleman’s coat, arrived on scene; pushing past the counter, before dipping his head with a deep bow. “How may I be of service, my lord?”

“Your finest baked goods, one of *each*, to be delivered to the Adventurer’s Guild at my summoning.” Ilunor stated tersely, without even looking the man in the eye.

“Of course, my lord. Your will be done.” He bowed deeply, before scurrying back behind the counter, and scribbling something on a parchment.

“And will my lord wish to open an account with this establishment, or—”

Ilunor responded to this question by simply reaching for his sack of coins, and slamming it *hard* on the counter, despite having to reach up *high* to do so.

“I haven’t the time to dilly-dally, nor the patience to deal with petty debt, so let us settle this *now*.” He spoke assertively, prompting the man to quickly tear off the slip of paper he was scrawling upon, before handing it to Ilunor.

Peeking over the Vunerian’s shoulder, the list I saw was… nothing short of *excessive*.

*But he did say one of everything, after all…*

A quick nod, and a signature of his own, marked what I assumed to be an acknowledgement of the transaction.

After which, a surge of mana radiation was noted, preceding what I could only describe as an animation pulled straight out of a videogame — as gold, silver, and copper coins flowed *up* from Ilunor’s pouch and into the elf’s own pouch.

Following this, the man handed Ilunor a small stone carved with runes. “Simply activate the stone, and we will rush to the adventurer’s guild post-haste, my lord.” He bowed once more, prompting Ilunor’s wordless departure from that bit of social interaction, as he left without so much as a ‘thank you’.

The moment we returned to the streets, however, was the moment that the culture shock of just being out here in town started to wear off. Or at least, enough that I could start addressing a few things.

“Right. So. Ignoring Ilunor’s rather abrasive interactions just now—” I spoke off-handedly, eliciting barely a huff from the Vunerian as he simply took in the sights, sounds, and most of all — the ‘respect’ being shown by every other passerby. “—I do have another item we need to add to the shopping list, Thacea.”

I quickly reached for the letter, before handing it off to the avinor.

A quick speed read later, and the princess soon gave me an answer as to exactly *what* the dean was asking for.

“I see the dean wishes to fulfill a formality.” Thacea began with a chirp. “A mana focus will do nothing for you, Emma. Given you lack a manafield, and the ability to use mana, this will merely be a paperweight for you to carry.”

“So… what exactly *is* it? The way it was phrased, it seems to be a tool for people with atypical manafields. I’m assuming it's like, some sort of a tool to help you augment a manafield?”

“That is correct, Emma.” Thacea nodded. “A mana focus is little more than an enchanted item, typically crafted in the form of a wand, through which a mage may focus their magical energies through — in the event that one’s own manafield is too unstable or has improperly matured. It is rare that a noble mage must resort to the use of a wand. Typically, it is seen only as a learning tool, or a crutch of sorts for children still developing their manafields.”

“Typically seen in children of nobility younger than twelve years of age, and not a year more. Extended use of it seems to paradoxically *hamper* manafield maturation, so twelve years is the cut-off point for most mages. Though there are a *few* who unfortunately become reliant on it, thus limiting their ability to use wandless magic.” Thalmin quickly added.

“And any mage who uses a wand as a crutch, is quite unfortunate indeed. As a wand, as with any enchanted item, *will* become worn out in time. This leaves oneself *vulnerable* to any second-rate wandless mage worth their money.” Ilunor surmised, as this topic opened an entirely new fascinating subject for me to chew on. “This is not even taking into account becoming *disarmed* in a fight. To be quite honest, a mage with a wand is just as pathetic as a guardsman with an enchanted weapon. Yes, the former may be capable of practicing magic as any other mage, but they are likewise left as powerless as a commoner if they do lose their wand; relegating them to becoming as ineffective as the latter.”

“Wait, so, can’t a commoner just you know… *use* a wand to enhance their manafield?” I questioned.

“It is clear we are yet again at another impasse with your ability to parse basic magic theory, Emma.” Ilunor hissed out. “It’s *in the name*, it’s a *mana-focus*. All it does is to aid in the *focusing* of one’s *existing* manafields. If a commoner were to use it, nothing would happen. If *you* were to use it, nothing would happen. Unlike an enchanted weapon, which still requires *training* mind you, wands aren’t enchanted to release a predetermined enchantment of mana using a commoner’s weak manafield. It’s instead, simply allowing a mage to focus their pre-existing strong, but atypical manafields.”

“I see.” I nodded, still processing this intel. “So… I’m assuming since the dean can’t file me in as ‘manaless’, that because of some archaic rule, that I’m now effectively forced to buy one simply because of my supposed ‘atypical manafield’?”

“That’s precisely it, Emma.” Thacea nodded, just as we rounded the corner and arrived at what appeared to be the town square.

A fountain dominated the central space, one that shot up impressively high, forming what appeared to be all sorts of shapes, symbols, and even entire words and letters, acting as a sort of weird cross between a New Vegas water show, and a public announcement board.

“Right, so, wands aren’t too expensive now, are they? I mean, I just want to be wary of my budget, after all.”

“A typical wand ranges anywhere from a few hundred gold coins, up to tens of thousands if you wish for a *tailor-made* one.” Ilunor responded.

“I’ll go for the cheapest one, thanks. It’s not like I’ll need it anyways.” I shrugged, before continuing on the path Thacea seemed to have already charted out for us.

We quickly moved through one of the many branching pathways from the central, circular plaza, arriving at a street with row upon row of particularly large and prominent buildings, with each lot taking up at least ten or so townhouses’ worth of storefronts alone. Context clues were enough to clue me in to exactly *what* these structures were. *Especially* the one with statues of knights in armor lining the tall steps, leading up to an oak door engraved with images of dragons, wyverns, and all sorts of beasts being slain by said knights.

“It doesn’t *look* open to me.” I offered, gesturing at the guild hall.

“It’s open alright. They just don’t openly *advertise* that they are.” Thalmin responded, as he ascended those steps first, rising about five feet before we reached the large doors of the guild hall; knocking hard on them using the provided door-knockers.

“Shall I order my bread-man to come now, or—”

“*After* we enter, Ilunor.” Thacea interjected, though it was already far too late if the *ringing* of his stone was of any indication.

“Ah.” He spoke, garnering a sigh from Thacea, as the stone quickly transformed into a mini-gargoyle and flew off. “The bread-man will be here shortly, so let us make our business quick.”

The doors quickly opened following that exchange, as a tall, large, and imposing figure dominated the space; his face obscured beneath a heavy cloak.

“Ah, welcome my lord.” The man spoke with an imposing cadence. “It is not often we have pupils at the academy visiting our establishment this early in the school year. Is there a quest you would like to request from the guild? If so, you are free to contact us through Professor Chiska or—”

“This is not a *typical* quest, I’m afraid.” Thalmin took the reins of the conversation, reaching for the door, and keeping it open.

“Oh? Pray tell, what sort of *atypical request* do you have in mind, my lord?”

“One which requires an immediate audience with your guild master.” The wolf prince stated in no uncertain terms, a low grumbling emanating from deep within his chest.

A moment of silence followed that demand, as the hooded figure looked off to his side, before nodding once.

“And an audience you shall gain… *mercenary prince*.”

The door swung open for us at that point, as the man gestured for us to enter…

But not before the mismatched footfalls of about ten people emerged from behind us. “My lord! Your delivery from Byron’s Best Baked Goods has arrived!”

This prompted the doorman to turn his attention towards Thalmin, cocking his head in the process. “... are they with you, my lord?”

To which Thalmin could only sigh in response, giving a stern look to Ilunor, before turning back towards the door man with a confident look. “A gesture of our good faith, and Havenbrockian hospitality, my fellow.”

(Author’s Note: Hey everyone! I'm back now! :D Thank you so much for being so patient with me over the past week, I really do hope this chapter is worth the wait! We finally head to Elaseer in this chapter, as Emma is intrigued and tries to mess around with the door portal that connects the Academy to Elaseer! In addition to this, this is our first real glimpse of the world outside of the Academy, which was really fun to explore and write out! It's really exciting to be able to dive deep into how the world works, looks, and feels, through its surroundings, through urban planning, design, and the architectural aesthetic choices made in reaction to, or coinciding with the rules and regulations set forth in this particular part of town! I just really want to convey the feel and vibe of a living breathing world, so I hope that I managed to convey all of that alright haha.

post,THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE to EVERY ATTACHMENT in Black Ops 6: In-Depth Explanations &amp; Use-Cases! ,2025-01-11 20:39:28,"# The Definitive Guide to Every Attachment in Black Ops 6

*An In-Depth Guide by* ***XVI the Great***

Black Ops 6 has a very simple Gunsmith, yet it can still be challenging to understand what attachments are worth using, and which ones aren’t. This guide is designed to serve as a definitive resource that explains every universal attachment in the game in a way that is helpful to players of all skill levels. If you ever ask yourself “is this attachment good or not?”, the explanation lies below. Specialty attachments, such as the Buffer Weight Stock, are not included.

Also included are the **use-cases** of each attachment that explains what weapon classes or playstyles an attachment is best used for. **This guide is written from the perspective of using 5 attachments in Multiplayer,** so when an attachment has a use-case of “None” - meaning it is *never* good to use because using a different attachment would simply be better – it means that it is not worth using as 1 of your 5 attachments. Many of these attachments are still beneficial to use in Gunfighter builds and have a use-case there. Ultimately, the use-cases are based on my personal opinion and years of experience building and optimizing weapon loadouts. At the end of the day, feel free to use what you want and do not let *anyone* tell you not to have fun.

The guiding principle behind my interpretation of each attachment is **whether it would benefit you in the majority of gunfights** – that is my #1 metric for good or bad.

# Optics

The following are **low-zoom, general use** scopes. The Kepler Microflex is realistically the only sight that should ever be used (except for Snipers), but other options are available, especially if you are having trouble hitting headshots on the camo grind.

* **Best All Around: Kepler Microflex**
   * The clearest, slimmest, least obtrusive frame.
* **Great for Headshots: Kepler Red Dot**
   * Just the right amount of zoom (1.25x) for hitting headshots with unprecedented scope clarity. I would consider this the best option for the camo grind.
* **Reduces Gun Kick (no ADS penalty):** Accu-Spot Ultra Holo (3x zoom)
   * A somewhat goofy shape, but no handling penalty.
* **Reduces Gun Kick (ADS penalty):** Jason Armory 2x (2x zoom), Willis 3x (3x zoom)
   * Very clean, usable scopes that appreciably make firing easier, but come with a small handling penalty.

# Muzzles

* **Suppressor**
   * **Effects:** No Minimap Firing Ping
   * **Use-Cases:** High-value universal attachment
   * The Suppressor is one of the highest-value attachments in the entire game and should absolutely, positively be used whenever possible. Every time you fire an unsuppressed weapon, you show up as a red dot on every enemy's minimap (in Hardcore, you only have a minimap while someone on your team has deployed a UAV, so Suppressors are not nearly as important there). Using a Suppressor to stay off the minimap is an absolute top priority. It makes a significant difference in how often enemies are able to be aware of you (audio-wise), not only are you harder to detect in combat (especially with occlusion), but going loud and unsilenced basically gives every single enemy in the game a direct, real-time, 100% accurate indicator that tells them exactly where you are, every single time you fire your weapon. My #1 tip to improve at Call of Duty is to learn how to religiously watch the minimap. If you look at any high-caliber player's gameplay, simply look at how often their eyes flick to the corner of the screen - back and forth, constantly. They're looking for that free information, and once an aware player knows where you are (because you aren’t using a Suppressor), it can practically be a free kill.
* **Compensator**
   * **Effects:** Strongest reduction of Vertical &amp; Visual Recoil  
   * **Use-Cases:** SMGs, and long-range accuracy over fully automatic, sustained fire
   * SMGs have an elevated, continuous level of recoil that is best mitigated by the Compensator. While the Ported Compensator may seem attractive, by proactively compensating for recoil and pulling down at the same time you fire, you can maintain laser-accurate fire despite bumpy conditions. The Compensator is also the best form of mitigation for using fully automatic weaponry over long distances, such as Assault Rifles and LMGs – it will provide the smoothest possible firing conditions in the slot.
* **Ported Compensator**
   * **Effects:** Medium reduction of Vertical &amp; Visual Recoil; special mitigation on first shot
   * **Use-Cases:** Weapons that jump significantly after firing, highly accurate players performing fully automatic fire over short periods of time, and burst weapons
   * Over extended periods of fully automatic fire, the Ported Compensator performs worse than the standard Compensator, so if you choose Ported, you are committing to hitting your opening barrage of shots for quick, precise, technical kills. If you fail to hit the majority of your opening shots, your recoil will be worse than if you had used the standard Compensator. As such, the Ported Compensator is ideal for Competitive and Ranked due to the high accuracy of competitive/professional players. These players are often holding specific angles with limited windows of time to kill targets as they cross; as such, they need the highest possible accuracy over a short period of time. If you are the type of player that shoots 5 and hits 4, the Ported Compensator is for you.
   * With regards to burst weapons, effective fire is dictated by starting and ending a burst on-target; burst weapons often have an intense first-shot kick, which runs the risk of knocking the rest of the burst off-target; mitigating that first shot is the key to maintaining accurate bursts over distance.
* **Muzzle Brake**
   * **Effects:** Special mitigation on first shot, reduces scope rebound\*, shortens recoil pattern reset period
   * **Use-Cases:** High-kick, slow rate of fire semi-automatic weapons, and an unknown amount of other weapons
   * This attachment functions in a most unexpected way, and not exactly a pleasant one. Thanks to the thorough sleuthing of u/TheXclusiveAce, the Muzzle Brake’s described functionality is rather misleading: It fails to improve the recenter speed of a weapon as expected, and only improves the rebound when returning back upwards to the point of origin. Think about firing a .50 caliber sniper – massive kick upwards followed by recentering back to where you were originally aiming – this part is unfortunately unaffected by the Muzzle Brake. As the scope falls back down, it will sink beneath the point you were originally aiming due to gravity, then rebound back upwards to the point of origin. This is the part that is improved by the Muzzle Brake, and that means using this attachment for that purpose is a waste of an attachment.
   * The real functionality of the Muzzle Brake is that it improves the speed at which a weapon’s recoil pattern resets. Under prolonged periods of sustained fire, a weapon’s recoil pattern gets progressively worse and more intense. Each weapon has a built-in timer that dictates when that recoil pattern resets to normal, as if you are firing it for the first time. The Muzzle Brake shortens that reset period. What is the recoil reset time of any given gun, you might ask? Until a talented-enough detective sniffs that out, or we are graced by the almighty wisdom of Treyarch themselves, nobody knows.
   * You may be tempted to use the Muzzle Brake on Snipers due to the recenter speed; you should not use this attachment on any bolt-action rifles because you can manually recenter after each shot. Any time human compensation or personal skill can replace the need for an attachment, you can build a better gun. The Muzzle Brake should only be used on high fire-rate semi-automatic rifles, like the Tsarkov 7.62, SVD, or AMR Mod 9.

# Barrels

* **Gain-Twist Barrel**
   * **Effects:** Strongest increase of Bullet Velocity
   * **Use-Cases:** Hardcore only on medium/large maps
   * **Disclaimer:** I know many players are concerned about Velocity and Hitscan range and might think this attachment is mandatory, but if you are only using 5 attachments, increasing your Hitscan range will only help you in an *occasional* gunfight rather than the *majority* of gunfights.
   * *Hitscan* refers to the maximum distance your bullet will instantly strike a target with zero travel time. Otherwise, for distant targets, your bullet may have a 10/20/30ms, etc. travel time before it hits the target, sinking due to gravity and possibly necessitating that you lead your target.
   * Hitscan is directly measured by your Bullet Velocity, divided by 20. For example, if you have 800 m/s Velocity, you will have a Hitscan range of 40 meters. If you fire at any targets 40 or less meters away, your bullets will not have a travel time and will instantly strike the target.
   * In the vast majority of gunfights, *especially* in Black Ops 6’s often-microscopic maps, Bullet Velocity will almost *never* be a factor. There are many misconceptions about Bullet Velocity, such as giving you better hit registration, it makes your guns “hit different”, or that you can “feel the difference”. These anecdotes are almost never true and I went extremely in-depth about the fallacies and misconceptions surrounding Bullet Velocity in last year’s [MW3 Advanced Stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareIII/comments/18t1otv/advanced_stats_whats_important_how_to_read_them/) guide, Section 5: “Bullet Velocity: The Single Most Misunderstood Stat in Call of Duty”.
* **Long Barrel**
   * **Effects:** Strongest increase of Damage Range
   * **Use-Cases:** All SMGs, Shotguns, and Pistols
   * For anyone unclear on Damage Range, the *Maximum* Damage Range is the distance from 0 meters (your gun) that your gun deals the “maximum” amount of damage – the numbers shown in the Advanced Stats.
   * SMGs live and die by Damage Range, as their TTKs fall off *very hard* the second you attempt to engage someone outside of it, so extending your maximum Damage Range on SMGs is practically mandatory. However, most Assault Rifles, Light Machine Guns, Marksman Rifles, and Sniper Rifles have extremely generous Damage Ranges that handle the majority of engagements without losing any damage, even over midrange.
   * If the vast majority of your gunfights occur within the Maximum Damage Range, the Long Barrel is a wasted attachment and you are actually playing with 4 attachments instead of 5. It is not worth using a Long Barrel for the 1 in 10 engagements where it *might* help; it is far more worthwhile to take an attachment that helps with 4 out of 5 engagements – namely a dot sight, Muzzle, Underbarrel, Magazine, Rear Grip, or Stock.
* **Reinforced Barrel**
   * **Effects:** Medium increase of Bullet Velocity &amp; Damage Range
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * **Repeat Disclaimer:** I know many players are concerned about Velocity and Hitscan range and might think this attachment is mandatory, but if you are only using 5 attachments, increasing your Hitscan range will only help you in an *occasional* gunfight rather than the *majority* of gunfights.
   * The explanation here is largely the same as the Gain-Twist Barrel: This is not an attachment that will help you in the *majority* of gunfights. However, with all of the weapon classes that do not need Range or Velocity boosts (AR, LMG, MR, SR), it *is* the perfect attachment to throw on with Gunfighter.
* **Short Barrel**
   * **Effects:** Reduces weapon handling penalties when jumping
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * Jumping is a generally ineffective form of movement during a gunfight in Black Ops 6, and for anyone unfamiliar, you receive both an ADS and S2F penalty if you attempt to aim and shoot while jumping. The jumping penalty combined with the almost complete removal of bunny-hopping means that the best way to challenge an enemy is almost never by initiating a jump. In combat, jumping is only useful to gain elevation and engage an enemy you otherwise cannot see from a standing position.
* **CHF Barrel**
   * **Effects:** Increases headshot damage; significantly increases recoil
   * **Use-Cases:** Sniper Rifles only
   * The CHF Barrel is an *awful* attachment, which is especially disappointing considering that the vast majority of time spent in the Multiplayer camo grind is getting headshots, so you would figure that the CHF Barrel is a no-brainer. In fact, it looks purpose-built to *help* with the camo grind! It is, in fact, a trap. Do NOT use this attachment. It should **always** reduce shots to kill when a single headshot is landed, but there are countless scenarios where equipping this attachment **literally does nothing, ever**, and only makes your gun worse. This attachment is lazily and irresponsibly implemented. If it cannot provide a benefit under any situation, it should not be allowed to be equipped.
   * In Core, there are plenty of scenarios where you can equip it and have the appreciable benefit of requiring one less headshot to kill, which sounds good, but there is a double downside to consider: (1) you deprive yourself of an attachment which could *ironically* help you get more headshot kills faster (2) the extreme recoil penalties increase your chance of missing, even in close quarters; if the added recoil causes you to miss shots, you are not actually able to take advantage of the faster time to kill
   * There are plenty of scenarios where the CHF Barrel can “help”, but there are even more scenarios where equipping it does *literally* nothing, and no matter what combination of shots you have – whether they are purely to the head or a mixture of head and body shots, you have a worthless attachment.
   * With Snipers, this should only be used if you struggle to hit enemies in the one-shot kill zone, which for each sniper, can be seen in the Advanced Stats by the area shaded in red. If that is too difficult for you, the CHF Barrel can make it a decent bit easier.

# Underbarrels

* **Vertical Foregrip (Some guns: “Weighted Handguard”)**
   * **Effects:** Strongest reduction of Horizontal Recoil
   * **Use-Cases:** High-value universal attachment for every weapon class except Shotguns and Snipers
   * One of the best, highest-value attachments in the entire game, the Vertical Foregrip provides best-in-slot reduction of Horizontal Recoil – one of the highest-priority stats. Vertical Recoil is extremely easy to compensate for; you simply pull down as soon as you begin firing. Horizontal Recoil, however, kicks in at different times on different weapons, in different directions and angles, and directly governs how stable a recoil plot is. The Vertical Foregrip will not remove your Horizontal Recoil, but in many cases it can make it negligible and, worst case scenario, makes your gun *very* easy to shoot.
* **Lightweight Foregrip**
   * **Effects:** Strongest reduction to Idle Sway
   * **Use-Cases:** Snipers only
   * The Lightweight Foregrip provides the strongest reduction to Aiming Idle Sway, which is the random bob and sway back and forth, up and down as you hold ADS. However, every gun has a stat called “ADS Idle Sway Delay” – when you enter ADS, this delay is the amount of time before your weapon starts swaying at full strength (so you have a generous ‘grace period’ before sway fully kicks in) which can certainly knock you off target. When using Snipers, with good centering and breath control, you can easily defeat the effects of Aiming Idle Sway.
* **Marksman Foregrip**
   * **Effects:** Adds “Hold Breath” to any weapon; reduces recoil &amp; adds small zoom while holding breath
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * The Marksman Foregrip is an inventive, interesting attachment, but simply has no real use. It works independently of your optic (so you can use whatever zoom desired or even no optic at all), and when you ADS, you gain the option to hold your breath. Doing so will reduce your recoil and zoom in, which can help capture some niche, precision kills. As a clever user in the comments pointed out, it can be used with Ironsight snipers (which have no glint - even using a red dot on a sniper will add glint), to zoom in without a scope and get a tiny bit more precise.
   * If you want to reduce recoil, use an attachment that reduces it every time you fire – not just the times you hold your breath. You never want to think about having to constantly hold your breath in the heat of battle; the manual maintenance required to use this attachment will *almost guaranteed* make you shoot worse and cause you to lose gunfights.
* **Precision Foregrip**
   * **Effects:** Moderate reduction of Horizontal Recoil; Minimal reduction to Idle Sway
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * The Precision Foregrip matches the Ranger Foregrip in terms of Horizontal Recoil reduction, but instead of enhancing your Sprint Speed, it improves your Aiming Idle Sway by a small amount. This attachment certainly sounds good for long-range engagements where you want a sensible blend of reduction of both Horizontal Recoil and Idle Sway, but the Horizontal Recoil reduction pales in comparison to the Vertical Foregrip, and the Aiming Idle Sway reduction is simply negligible. This attachment does two things poorly, so do not use it.
   * If you are using a high-zoom scope and looking for something like this for long-range engagements, you can hold your breath to freeze the sway *or* exit and re-enter ADS to reset Idle Sway and reactivate your ADS Idle Sway Delay, which would allow you to instead use the Vertical Foregrip, making you more accurate overall.
* **Ranger Foregrip**
   * **Effects:** Moderate reduction of Horizontal Recoil; increases Sprint Speed
   * **Use-Cases:** Universal applicability except Snipers &amp; Shotguns
   * For any gun with light-enough Horizontal Recoil that you don’t need the full mitigation of the Vertical Foregrip for, the Ranger Foregrip is a great option for mixing recoil reduction with mobility, but remember this: Sprinting faster is nice, but Sprint Speed doesn’t help you in a gunfight. In a gunfight, your more pertinent stats are things like Strafe Speed and Horizontal Recoil, so the Vertical Foregrip is generally the better choice, and I feel comfortable using the Ranger Foregrip only on Nuketown or small maps.
* **Launcher (Standard / Smoke / High Explosive / Drill Charge)**
   * **Effects:** Adds Underbarrel launcher
   * **Use-Cases:** Personal preference
   * This attachment is more for “class fantasy” and immersive play and has no real use-case, but never let anyone tell you not to have fun.

# Magazines

* **Extended Magazine Level 1**
   * **Effects:** Increases Magazine Capacity; Reduces Reload Speed
   * **Use-Cases:** High-value universal attachment
   * Because there is no option to reload faster except by taking an outright penalizing Magazine attachment, this tilts your choice in favor to making the magazine bigger. On all weapon classes, Extended Magazine 1 comes with zero penalties except making your reload slightly slower (in most cases), making it the logical choice.
* **Extended Magazine Levels 2/3/4**
   * **Effects:** Increases Magazine Capacity; Reduces Reload Speed &amp; slows ADS / S2F / Strafe
   * **Use-Cases:** Select weapons with high ROF; player preference
   * Using an Extended Magazine beyond Level 1 almost universally comes with a further penalized reload time, in addition to new ADS &amp; S2F penalties and possible Movement Speed penalties. For weapons that burn through their magazine in the blink of an eye (AS-VAL, Kompakt 92, GPMG), these attachments are definitely worth the downsides.
* **Fast Mag Levels 1/2/3**
   * **Effects (Level 1):** Reduces Reload Speed
   * **Effects (Level 2/3):** Reduces Reload Speed and Magazine Capacity; Enhances ADS / S2F / Strafe Speed
   * **Use-Cases:** None; Snipers only
   * Fast Mag 1 provides an insultingly low increase to reload speed in exchange for losing a whole attachment slot to accomplish so little. Fast Mag 2 and 3 actually *reduce* your magazine capacity to further reduce your reload speed (by proportionally paltry amounts) while also providing ADS, S2F, and possible Movement Speed bonuses. The bonuses sound attractive, but reducing your magazine size in a game with tiny maps, terrible spawns, and a slow TTK for such negligible benefit is a truly losing combination. The only reasonable application is gaining faster ADS on a Sniper Rifle.
* **Flip Mag**
   * **Effects:** Reduces Magazine Capacity (Some\*); Reduces Reload Speed every other Reload
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * Just like with Fast Mag, using this attachment is kind of like playing with 4 attachments instead of 5. The reload speed benefit is negligible, and to add insult to injury, the faster reload speed only applies *every other reload*. Absolutely horrific attachment; stay far away.

# Rear Grips

* **Quickdraw Grip**
   * **Effects:** Strongest reduction of ADS time
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * The Quickdraw Grip provides the best possible gain of ADS with no penalties, (except for Snipers, which gain the ADS bonus but with a heavy hit to Flinch Resistance). For everything else, it’s a great attachment, but it should be replaced with the Ergonomic Grip (or Commando for Snipers) as soon as it is unlocked.
* **Assault Grip**
   * **Effects:** Strongest reduction of S2F time
   * **Use-Cases:** Non-Omnimovement Hipfire and Strelok builds
   * The Assault Grip provides the best possible gain to Sprint to Fire (S2F). Hipfire-only builds, such as Akimbo Saugs and Hipfire-maximized Shotguns should only use this grip until they unlock the CQB Grip. If you don’t use Omnimovement at all (sliding/diving), then this would be the best option.
   * To learn about the Strelok Laser and why it is so good, visit the Lasers section.
* **Commando Grip**
   * **Effects:** Medium reduction of ADS &amp; S2F time
   * **Use-Cases:** Snipers Only
   * This attachment is best in slot for Snipers since it provides the biggest boost to ADS without the penalty to Flinch Resistance (the Quickdraw Riser and Ergonomic Riser both heavily penalize Flinch Resistance).
   * The Commando Grip should only be used on non-Snipers if you do not use any form of Omnimovement; only traditional strafing and shooting.
* **Ergonomic Grip**
   * **Effects:** Medium reduction of ADS time; strong reduction to Slide &amp; Dive to Fire time
   * **Use-Cases:** Non-Strelok Omnimovement
   * If you slide or dive routinely (you should at least be sliding routinely) and do not use the Strelok Laser, this is your best-in-slot attachment. The Ergonomic Grip provides a nominal boost to ADS with massive reductions to your Slide and Dive to Fire Times, -50% to each. Considering that these timings are both usually 370ms by default, that is a massive improvement and completely changes how you can take advantage of Omnimovement.
   * How Slide &amp; Dive to Fire Times Work: Thanks once again to the thorough sleuthing of u/TheXclusiveAce, SL2F and D2F times actually ignore both your ADS and S2F times, even if you were sprinting beforehand. You will be able to fire as soon as your SL2F or D2F time is up, regardless of how long it takes you to ADS (and if your ADS is slower than your SL2F or D2F times, it will not be throttled).
* **CQB Grip**
   * **Effects:** Medium reduction of S2F time; strong reduction to Slide &amp; Dive to Fire time
   * **Use-Cases:** Hipfire-only weapons; otherwise, only in combination with the Strelok Laser
   * When using Hipfire weapons, this grip allows you to slide without a massive firing delay.
   * To learn about the Strelok Laser and why it is so good, visit the Lasers section.

# Stocks

* **Light Stock / No Stock**
   * **Effects:** Strongest increase to non-sprint movement speed from the hip only
   * **Use-Cases:** Hipfire builds only
   * This will only provide a benefit when moving while standing/crouching and holding your weapon at the hip, but not while performing more important forms of movement: sprinting or aim-walking. Use exclusively with Hipfire-only weapon builds.
* **Infiltrator Stock**
   * **Effects:** Strongest increase to Strafe Speed
   * **Use-Cases:** High-value universal attachment
   * The Infiltrator Stock provides the best possible increase to Aim Walking Movement Speed (aka Strafe). One of the most important forms of movement in a gunfight is something that happens automatically - Strafe Speed. Having a fast enough Strafe Speed allows you to actually “dodge bullets” by laterally moving away from your opponent’s aim.
* **Heavy Stock**
   * **Effects:** Strongest increase to Flinch Resistance
   * **Use-Cases:** Snipers, weapons with high-zoom scopes
   * Flinch is generally not a large concern on most weapon classes but is extremely important on Snipers. This attachment can be used to counter the penalty from the Quickdraw Riser, but if you’re reading this guide, you know there’s a better way to gain good ADS without compromising on Flinch (Commando Riser).
* **Balanced Stock**
   * **Effects:** Medium increase to non-sprinting movement speed from the hip and medium increase to Strafe Speed (no bonus to Sprint Speed)
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * The Balanced Stock is a combination between the Light and Infiltrator Stocks at almost exactly half the strength of both, enhancing the speed of all categories affected by both of those stocks, but to a lesser degree. Ultimately, using the Balanced Stock represents an indecision between Hipfire-only or ADS-only; you should choose between one or the other and accentuate that playstyle with either of the other stocks.
* **Combat Stock**
   * **Effects:** Medium increase to Strafe Speed and minimal reduction to Flinch Resistance
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * Providing a boost to Strafe Speed equal to half the strength of the Infiltrator Stock, but approximately one-third of the Flinch Resistance of the Heavy Stock, the Combat Stock is yet another hybrid attachment that does two things poorly instead of one thing good.

# Lasers

* **Steady Aim Laser**
   * **Effects:** Strongest increase to Hipfire accuracy
   * **Use-Cases:** Shotguns kitted for Hipfire, Akimbo weapons
   * I think a lot of players use the Steady Aim Laser without considering how often it would actually benefit them, thinking it would be nice to have just in case they get into close-quarters engagements. The reality is that the vast majority of engagements in CoD occur at distances where the best and only option is to ADS. If you are using the Steady Aim Laser but ADS during 95% of your gunfights, then you are using a wasted attachment 95% of the time. It simply isn’t worth using this attachment unless your playstyle is dedicated to Hipfiring.
* **Fast-Motion Laser**
   * **Effects:** Increases Hipfire accuracy during Omnimovement
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * The Fast Motion Laser appreciably improves your Hipfire accuracy during Omnimovement, but not by an amount that makes it worth using. This attachment is far too situational to ever provide real benefit, but it does let you get cool action-hero kills during Omnimovement if that’s your thing.
* **Tactical Laser**
   * **Effects:** Enables Tactical Stance
   * **Use-Cases:** Preference with Shotguns
   * The Tactical Laser allows you to enter TacStance, a hybrid between ADS and Hipfire that increases your movement speed at the cost of accuracy and performs best in close to mid-range, but always risks being outgunned due to the loss of accuracy. To enable TacStance, you must first ADS, then press the TacStance key / button (on controller, the default mapping is left on the D-Pad). TacStance is generally inadvisable for all weapon classes except Shotguns, where it does have a very real and competitive use-case. While using Shotguns, if you don’t like the handling delay of aiming down sights but also don’t like the range limitations of hipfiring, TacStance is your perfect middle ground. It will give you a tighter pellet spread than Hipfire (but worse than ADS), but will allow you to aim faster than fully aiming down sights. I strongly prefer Hipfiring with Shotguns, but TacStance might be your preference and it would not put you at a competitive disadvantage.
* **Strelok Laser**
   * **Effects:** Replaces your ADS time with your S2F time
   * **Use-Cases:** High-value universal attachment
   * To put it plainly, the Strelok Laser is a VERY good attachment. It effectively disregards your ADS time and allows you to achieve near-ADS-level accuracy as soon as you finish sprinting out and begin raising your weapon from your hip to ADS, meaning that you are effectively ADS’d as soon as you start raising your weapon.
   * **How to Use the Strelok Laser:** Your muscle memory is likely ADS *then* fire, but with the Strelok Laser, you want to ADS and fire **at the same time**, since the Strelok Laser will significantly improve your accuracy as you raise your weapon from hip to ADS. This means you want to improve your S2F speed since you will technically begin engagements by firing from the hip. It doesn’t matter how long it takes you to fully ADS since you will have nearly-full accuracy with the Strelok Laser, which very effectively and very accurately bridges the gap until you fully enter ADS.
   * **How ADS &amp; S2F Work:** When you are sprinting and begin to ADS, the game will weigh your ADS speed against your S2F speed; the slower value of the two will be chosen, and your ADS will be throttled to that value. However, your S2F has a hidden secondary value depending on whether you were *Sprinting* or *TacSprinting*. If you were TacSprinting, your S2F time is, on average, 100ms slower.
   * **Example:** You have an ADS time of 200ms but an S2F time of 250ms. If you are sprinting and begin to ADS, you will ADS in 250ms. This is why it is important to balance ADS &amp; S2F, especially when considering the invisible TacSprint penalty.
* **Target Laser**
   * **Effects:** Increases ADS Idle Sway Delay and reduces scope movement while moving
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * This attachment used to be a necessary crutch for Snipers as Aiming Idle Sway prevented Snipers from aiming down sight perfectly on-target (the reticle would be off-center and force you to recenter on the target), but Treyarch has since adjusted that silly behavior and added an appropriate Aiming Idle Sway Delay to all Snipers. If you still find sway to be a problem, you should consider better rationing of holding your breath, but you can also use the Target Laser as it increases the Idle Sway Delay.

# Fire Mods

* **Recoil Springs**
   * **Effects:** Moderate reduction of Vertical, Horizontal, and Visual Recoil
   * **Use-Cases:** High-recoil weapons in conjunction with another recoil-reducing attachment
   * The Recoil Springs are a decent hybrid attachment that uniformly reduces your Vertical Recoil, Horizontal Recoil, and Gun Kick, but provides the least amount of benefit in each category compared to the “real” recoil reduction attachments. If you need an attachment to reduce recoil, you should choose either a Muzzle or an Underbarrel first before the Recoil Springs. This attachment is best used on weapons where either one of those attachments does not do a good enough job of reducing recoil by itself and needs extra assistance. For example, the Kompakt 92’s recoil can be *quite crazy*, and if you find too much difficulty staying on target, it would be helpful to use the Recoil Springs for an extra boost to reduce both your physical and visual recoil.
* **Rapid Fire**
   * **Effects:** Increases Fire Rate; significantly increases recoil
   * **Use-Cases:** Reducing the burst delay on burst weapons and improving rechamber speed on Snipers
   * While Rapid Fire can technically be used on any weapon, it does come with a significant recoil penalty – so if you want to improve your TTK a small margin, expect to lose the ability to challenge more distant targets you could previously challenge without a problem. Ultimately, the TTK gain is only truly beneficial if you are a highly-accurate player who can control recoil very well and generally hit 4 out of every 5 shots at minimum. If you cannot hit nearly every shot, the missed shots will end up making your TTK slower than your non-Rapid Fire TTK. If you use Rapid Fire, you *cannot* miss.
   * On burst weapons, such as the Swat and AEK, this is an invaluable attachment because it is the only attachment that can provide an appreciable reduction in the delay between bursts and is well worth the recoil penalty. On bolt-action Snipers, such as the LW3A1 and LR 7.62, you practically suffer no penalty and reduce the delay between shots.
* **FMJ**
   * **Effects:** Reduces damage penalty when shooting through objects; increases damage when shooting Scorestreaks
   * **Use-Cases:** None
   * FMJ is generally not worth using because Penetration Kills are extremely uncommon, and dedicating a full attachment slot to only *occasionally* benefit you is a poor choice; you want to use attachments that help you every single gunfight. Even so, I recall testing the efficacy of FMJ in Hardcore to improve my Nuketown wallbangs, and by the time I reached the fifth AR with *absolutely no change* in shots to kill with and without FMJ, I decided not to continue.
* **Overpressured**
   * **Effects:** Moderate increase to Bullet Velocity
   * **Use-Cases:** Hardcore only on medium/large maps
   * **Threepeat Disclaimer:** I know many players are concerned about Velocity and Hitscan range and might think this attachment is mandatory, but if you are only using 5 attachments, increasing your Hitscan range will only help you in an *occasional* gunfight rather than the *majority* of gunfights.
   * For the sake of sharing, there is only one area where I have found the stacking of both Gain-Twist Barrel and Overpressured to be useful: Pistol headshots in Hardcore. Pistols have such low Velocity that at midrange, bullets fired at headshot-level sink to the neck area due to low Velocity – there’s a helpful camo grind tip for you: Gain-Twist + Overpressured on Pistols in Hardcore.

post,Dad tips,2018-06-29 21:03:45,"I found out a couple weeks ago that some friends are pregnant with their first. I wrote this to help them prepare for it. FWIW, I have an almost 3 year old and a 4.5 month old. I hope this helps some dads to be, here!

Feel free to add anything you think I missed (there are things I thought of after I emailed this to my buddy and told him later but did not put into this).  After we've got some responses, I'll see how much of this we can add to the wiki here.

**Before**

* Go to all baby appointments!  This is probably a no brainer for you but some people don't realize it.  Ultrasounds are cool!  And it's really great to ask the ObGyn or midwife any and all questions you have!  (ie, I asked before #1 was born when I'd be able to hear his hearbeat.  The ObGyn said, ""in just a minute, I have the doppler right here.""  ""no, I mean with my ear against her belly."" ""oh, never, it's too loud in there and baby's heartbeat gets drowned out."")
* Go to some birth classes.  But maybe not all of them.  Depends how many you're encouraged to go to; KP advised ALL of them and they're tiring and tedious and mostly boring. I skipped the breastfeeding one, from the sounds of it, that was a good choice because it was a bunch of women trying to learn to breast feed dolls with at least one boob hanging out.  L&amp;D class was like 8 hours on a Saturday with like 30 couples.  We went through the whole process.  It was exhausting.  I'm not sure it helped much because when you get to it, you listen to what the medical team is advising.
* Start planing to buy shit now (or starting at week 13)  If you're going to do one, make a registry, do the showers, and see what people get you.  Get your big ticket items (car seats, strollers, cribs, etc) onto something like camelcamelcamel or other pricewatch and buy the sales.  I bought our stroller as an OpenBox deal on Amazon.  Still paid $300 for it but that's better than the $500 retail.  More on gear later.
* If you're going to get a doula, start meeting them now and find someone you like.  My yoga studio has a ""meet the doulas"" event one night every month or so where they all give a spiel and then you can hang out and talk to them.  We went but I had to chase our toddler around so I didn't get to sit in on the thing.  We found a doula to be really helpful, mostly because it made it feel like there was a person on our team that wasn't a hospital employee and it gave me more comfort in being able to leave the room to run home for things as needed.  In retrospect, a doula would have been probably even better with the first delivery than the second but live and learn.
* Pregnancy sucks.  Did no one tell you that?  Plenty of women say they loved being pregnant (Wife said she enjoyed being pregnant with our first, not so much the second as she had miserable heartburn every day.  She carried a bag of tums with her at all times and called them her ""after dinner mints"".) and I have no doubt some do.  I support that and their feelings.  But you're beginning what will likely be one of or the most life changing choice you'll ever make and prior to that little bundle of giggles popping out, your partner gets to go through a roller coaster of hormones (I lucked out with wife, she's even keeled and that part wasn't bad) as well as body changes that are sure to wreak havoc on psyche.  ""I'm the heaviest I've ever been!""  Well, yea, you've got a baby inside you, you've never had a baby inside you before.  Really messed with wife when I put my boot on the scale at a visit and tipped the scales to something like 190.  She was like ""OMG, I've really packed it on in these weeks!""  The med assistant gave me wry smile and wife turned to see me close and scrunched her nose and shook a fist.  Fun stuff.
* Did I say pregnancy sucks?  Libido will be all over the place.  So will body comfort both physically and mentally.  You just roll with it as you can.  Near the end (and especially once the baby has come) your partner's breasts will probably be the largest, shapeliest, and most enticing they have ever been.  And it may be entirely likely you're are not allowed to play with them, touch them, look at them, breath on them, or even think about them because they're sore and maybe leaking, and goddamnit I'm a cow now, MOOO.  (Wife has said moo a couple times in the last couple weeks when I walk in and she's pumping; I think all the pumping is taking a toll on us both.  It's a lot more work that breastfeeding but it allows me a wonderful amount of involvement with the baby which allows for more bonding and I feel way more connected to #2 than I did our first at this age).
* Of course, the above are not absolutes, all women are different and pregnancies are different.  We had plenty of sexy time while pregnant with #1 and comparatively none with #2.  Part of that was how hard the second pregnancy was and part of that was that we already had a kid and were doing parent things so were tired.  So it goes.
* Plan some vacation now; especially if leave from work is not a concern.  First trimester can be rough but things generally smooth out in the second.  We went to Nicaragua and hiked an active volcano when wife was 4 months preg with #1.  Do that shit now, it will be a while until you'll want (or have the energy) to travel and we're a lot less adventurous now that we're caring for kid and infant.  No surprise there
* Start familiarizing yourself with the alphabet soup.  FMLA, CFRA, PFL, SDL.  Family Medical Leave Act; California Family Rights Act; Paid Family Leave; Short Term Disability Leave.  These will require paperwork from medical offices to employers and to the state.  Get these submitted as required and make use of those benefits.  You can always do more work.  One day your baby is crying for you and wants to be held and snuggled, the next he's telling you to get out of the chicken run, you don't go in there, and he'll put you in timeout.  It's fucking hard but not so that you'd want to miss it.
* Know your employment contract/policies/etc as well as your boss's position on family life and work culture.  Don't be guilted into anything that is less than the full amount you are entitled to.  
* In the same vein as the above point, you won't believe (maybe you will) the amount of assholes who will tell you, ""you won't be able to wait to get back to work!"" or ""why are you taking so much time?"" or ""You'll get sick of being home and come back early.""  No two ways about this: fuck those people.
* Know multiple routes to your hospital and how long it take to get there in the worst traffic.  First babies are generally slow to come but it's a goddamn roller coaster of excitement when something like water breaking happens and you have to get up and go.

**Labor and Delivery**

* By now you should have a car seat base installed into the car and a proper car seat in it, waiting for the moment.  Leave this in the car, the hospital will likely not let you leave without it.  Find a place to inspect the installation; some hospitals do it, so do fire departments.  Google/call around or ask at your next ObGyn visit.
* You need a Go Bag.  Or one each.  This should include:  

   * personal care products
   * phone chargers
   * other distraction things (labor can be literally hours of just sitting waiting)
   * list of mom's meds (or mental knowledge)
   * known allergies!
   * birth plan if you have one
   * a change of clothes (as a dirty man, I think I brought a shirt, lol)
   * clothes for baby to go home in (don't just bring NB size!  A 0-3 onesie is a good idea too; never know how big that baby is going to be)
   * lacrosse ball or whatever; hospital room accommodation for mom is alright, Dad is probably going to be on a pull out chair or couch.  
   * Comfortable, easy on/off, loose clothes for mom. 
* You'll mostly be told what/where/how to do things once you're in the hospital.  However, you have some choice too.  Mom doesn't have to labor laying down on her back with her feet in stirrups.  You can walk around, (depending on facility) use a bath tub, roll onto sides, hands and knees, etc.  
* Pain management is important.  Something I think helped with #2 is that instead of going straight for an epidural, wife elected for Nitrous Oxide.  So as she felt a contraction coming, she'd hold the cup over her face and breath the N2O until about the peak of the contraction.  Obviously not enough to knock her out but enough to take some of the edge off the contraction.  (Apparently, this used to be really common, then much less so since the 80s? 90s? then has come back into favor after new research more recently.  
* Epidural is an option.  Talk to your ObGyn about this.  TL;NotAHealthCareProvider is it numbs things drastically and therefore often requires IV synthetic oxytocin to be administered to advance the labor.  More interferey, more possibility for complicationy.
* You'll likely be offered to cut the cord.  I noped the fuck out of cutting #1's.  When they asked me way before #2 came out, I said ""no way"".  But when the time came I spoke up and told them I wanted to.  I don't really remember it honestly.  I mean, I do, but it isn't that significant in my mind.  I'd recommend doing it, though.
* AFAIK, episiotomies are no longer recommended but that isn't to say tearing won't happen.  It probably will.  It will have to be stitched up.  It comes in four grades. Vaginal wall, vaginal muscle, rectal muscle, rectal wall.  I don't remember the grading numbers, 1-4 I think.  First kid caused a 3, second a 2.  Recovery from the 2 was much faster than the 3.  
* Feeding the baby as soon and as much as possible is important.  Gotta get that nasty poop (don't remember what it's called) out as it is related to jaundice problems.  Jaundice is also apparently caused by a blood type (RH) mismatch, between mother and baby and we had this problem with #2.  We spent like 24+ hours keeping him under blue lights and trying like hell to stuff his body full.  Once he regained birthweight, all concerns related to the RH mismatch were gone and we were out of the dark.  
* Breastfeeding can be hard for mother and baby at first.  Use lactation consultants and get help.  Mom's who breast feed have a lower risk of post partum depression
* Dads can get post partum depression too.  Maybe google around and be aware of the risk factors and signs for both of you.

**Gear**

* Car seats all have to meet the same safety standards.  Get one that is light enough to be comfortable, is easy to get in and out, and fits in your car well.  That last bit is more important for older kid carseats than infant because infant seats all seem to have the same base size.
* Crib: they're fucking expensive.  We got ours from Pottery Barn, somewhere we would never shop, only because one of wife's friend's moms gave us $200 in gift cards for there for our wedding.  I think we still paid like $400 for the crib after the cards applied.  But #2 is using it now too so maybe that's not insane.
* Stroller, as mentioned above, it's expensive.  We had a Graco or something that we bought because it would hold the infant seat and it was cheap.  It fucking sucked and I hated walking/running with it and it didn't maneuver well. Then we went on a hike and borrowed a BOB.  It's a great stroller.  We bought our own.  #1 still rides in it on evening walks while we carry his brother on our chest.  And this weekend we snapped the adapter into it and put #2's car seat on it and went to the Farmer's Market.  Again, if you're comfy with the idea, Amazon Warehouse/Open Box deals.  I wanted a stroller with a swiveling front wheel that had the option to lock as well as an adjustable handle.  I found the handle on our old stroller was too low and was uncomfortable for long periods of pushing.  The adjustable height on the BOB handle is nice.  I think the biggest thing here is to get a stroller that fits your lifestyle.  
* A [baby swing](https://www.buybuybaby.com/store/category/gear-travel/infant-activity/swings/32026/) is handy.  It's nice to have something that rocks them and plays music/white noise.  We've got one that has a mobile as well.  Given the time frame, I think you guys are welcome to ours.  It's a little squeaky but wholly functional.
* A bouncing chair gets even more use, for us, with both kids.  We have one [like this](https://m.bedbathandbeyond.com/m/product/fisher-price-reg-sweet-snugapuppy-dreams-bouncer/1060769749?skuId=60769749&amp;mcid=PS_googlepla_nonbrand_baby_online&amp;product_id=60769749&amp;adtype=pla&amp;product_channel=online&amp;adpos=1o53&amp;creative=224186171444&amp;device=m&amp;matchtype=&amp;network=g&amp;mrkgadid=3176331679&amp;mrkgcl=609&amp;rkg_id=h-0d17d1bd656a886269a47241e10a5375_t-1530800094&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwg_fZBRAoEiwAppvp-fNHgwAfAmULKYGimNi-JF0XnrWq7rOiZsbO0bsCGJe9prDy0R1CXhoCcj4QAvD_BwE).  It worked really well for both kids and we use it ALL the time.  Several times/day.
* Water proof mattress covers.  covers, with an 's'.  Because you want two of them.  Make the crib twice: cover, sheet, cover, sheet.  That way when the inevitable 2am blowout happens, you strip down the first two layers quick and go back to sleep.  We changed and replaced too many sheets with #1 before we learned this one.
* A baby carrier.  Ayayay.  We've had like 4 of these things.  Bjorn (meh); Baby Onya (used a lot but was never very comfortable for either of us); one other I can't remember, and now a Lille Baby which we both like and find very comfortable.  Wife also got a Ribozo from our doula.  It's a 15' long wrap.  It works well for wife and #2 looks so cozy in it.  Generally she uses that and I use the Lille but she sometimes uses the Lille.  I haven't tried the Ribozo yet but don't think I will.
* Bottles.  Holy crap there are so many.  With #1 we ended up liking Tommee Tippee the best but #2 had trouble with them.  We went to Dr. Brown's for him.  They're expensive but seem to really help cutting down the sucked air.  (getting him off formula really helped get rid of his fussiness too).   If breastfeeding, this isn't really a concern
* A bottle warmer.  In both our condo and here in our house, we leave a bottle warmer near the bed.  At night we put a cooler with bottles next to the bed and warm them as needed throughout the night.  It's basically a small hot plate that you add water to and it boils/steams the bottles.  Works alright.  
* Big swaddles.  Not these stupid like 18-24""x 30"" buggers that are everywhere.  We got some this time around that are like 36x36"" and they work way better.

**Baby Care**  
You're going to want some things on hand so that you don't have to go get them at the 24hour CVS at 2am.  I've done this.  On multiple occasions (once from a hotel room in an hour or so south of Sacramento because we didn't bring things with us; it sucked)

* Tylenol.  Children's tylenol has the same concentration as baby tylenol but is generally (no exaggeration) less total cost for twice the volume.  Often the difference is the cap--baby tylenol has a cap that receives a syringe, children's often doesn't.  So decant into the lid or a dosage cup and draw it with the syringe.  ""But children's tylenol doesn't come with a syringe?!""  Go to the pharmacy window and ask for a liquid medicine dosing syringe.  They have them for free.  The thing to make sure is that the tylenol is 160mg/5ml.  
* Ibuprofen.  Kids can't have this until 6 months.  At which point, get some and keep it on hand so you can cycle Tylenol/IB as needed.
* Baby gas drops.  The drug is Simethicone.  Get a couple bottles and keep on hand.  
* Gripe water.  It is natural gas remedy and supposed to help sooth the tummy.  It's like fennel or some other herbacious shit.  
* thermometer.  We've got rectal, oral, and one that goes into ear.  The first two have gotten lots of use.  The aural, not much; wiggly kids are tough. Don't confuse which one goes in what hole.
* We recently bought an otoscope so we can see if it's worthwhile to head to the Ped/urgent care for ear problems.  I think it was like $40 on Amazon; comparing that to copays, it seemed reasonable.
* Lanolin.  For diaper rash (also chapped nipples).  There are other options for diaper rash too.  Lanolin seemed to do the best job with the least disgustingness.  Coconut oil is nice for general use as well but not great for severe rash.
* Baking soda.  This isn't a carry with everywhere thing, it's more for dealing with diaper rash at home.  But a good amount into a bath really seems to soothe skin.  I just dump a bunch in.  If you get it from somewhere other than the grocery store it's super cheap.
* Q-tips for boogers and ear wax
* Put your pediatrician's number into both your phones under something like ""PEDIATRICIAN"" so it's easy to find.
* to couple with above, most places (especially down there) or insurance providers have an ""advice nurse"" who is a great, free resource to call with questions.  It's kind of like triage in that they can help you decide if the kid needs to be seen by medical providers.  Put this number into your phone too.

**Baby at home**

* Sleep when the baby sleeps
* Read about sleep training and decide what you're going to do.  It doesn't have to be concrete, but it helps to have a plan and start early.
* Co sleeping is done around the world but largely frowned on in America.  New research is suggesting maybe America rethink that (saw that headline yesterday, I think).  Do what's right for you.  Generally, our babies slept better with us when young but we slept like shit with them in bed.  We normally only brought them to bed when they needed comfort.  
* Happiest Baby on the Block is a book or video or something that gets rave reviews.  We watched the dude who created it in a KP class on infant care.  Swaddling and ""shhh-ing"" really calm an angry baby.  
* Youtube some swaddling techniques.  There's kind of a standard version and a ""frog"" version.  I only did the frog version with #1 a little bit near the end of his swaddling but it worked well.  I use the standard (draw a straight edge of cloth--I use stretchy blanket, often--across the baby, right shoulder to left hip; draw the excess from below them up tight to the left shoulder; draw the remainder tight from left shoulder to right shoulder.  Bam.  Swaddled and happy
* White noise machines are recommended frequently to help kids sleep.  We play little musics when he's in his chair or swing and have [one of these for the crib](https://www.amazon.com/New-Baby-Einstein-Dreams-Soother/dp/B01JVSYFTS/ref=sr_1_11_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1527822347&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=baby+einstein+under+the+sea) but #2 doesn't seem to be into it whereas #1 would zone out on it and pass out.
* Reflux is a common issue with baby because they're lower esophogeal valve doesn't work like ours.  It's also the reason they vomit when burping, I think.  A folded tower underneath the own end of the crib mattress can really help to ease some fussiness if this is an issue.
* Gas pain is really common especially with bottle fed and formula babies and with all babies until the gut develops more (4+ months, I think).  laying them on their back and ""bicycling"" their legs can be helpful, so can pushing but legs up to a squatty position when they are on the back.  Once they're a bit older and can hold head up, laying them across the lap with hips hanging off one side and head off the other can be beneficial as well.
* People will want to touch your baby the same way they want to touch your dog--without asking.  Think about how you want to handle this.
* the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends basically 0 screen time until 2 years.  
* If the kid won't stop screaming and you've done everything and are losing your shit, put it down in it's crib and take a breather.  It is safe in it's crib and you'll feel both a million times better and like an asshole for having been frustrated.  
* Learn Infant, Child, and pregnant woman heimlich and CPR if you don't know it already
* Lock the poisons away now.
* Schedule time to give your partner a break and do the same for yourself.  This is ""me"" time.  A walk around the neighborhood, watching the ocean, circus time, a cup of coffee, walking through the shops downtown.  Whatever.  Just make plans to send one another away alone.  You don't realize how much you worry about the kids until you're not with them.  You'll hear a baby while out and go into high alarm then realize, ""oh, that's not mine.""
* Find a good baby sitter and plan dates.  Between date expenses and the sitter it's fucking expensive.  It's worth it. 
* Read to your kid every night.  We haven't started with #2 consistently yet but will soon.  #1 gets his books every night.  It's a wonderful time to expand their vocabulary, teach them, and also cuddle, bond, and relax.   

I think more than anything, trust yourselves and your instincts.  All manner of things are said to make your life and baby easier, happier, healthier, smarter, etc.  Most are just to make money for other people.  ",514,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/8uvq8o/dad_tips/,low-traffic zones,
comment,,2018-08-06 03:09:39,"I think that people should look at the risks and decide what's best for them based on their situation. Bedsharing does cause a statistically significant increase in SIDS occurrence, but based on our situation we decided to take that risk because the risk of us doing something fucking idiotic while braindead from sleep deprivation was orders of magnitude more likely. I get why the back is best campaign exists and support it, and I am in no way advocating against it.

Our situation: Before cosleeping my wife left an oven burner on overnight and I almost turned left into oncoming traffic. The sleep deprivation was insane. After that we used a sidecar bassinet co-sleeper but daughter always ended up in the bed after her first wake up in order to dream feed. I was hyper aware of her being in the bed and mom instinctively played defense. Mom exclusively breastfed and she 'spooned' or cradled baby during nights. We had a lot of anxiety about it but everyone really did sleep better, which made us way less likely to drive into oncoming traffic the next day or leave burners on. We had no issues transitioning her to her own room at 6 months. She's now 8 months and fully sleep trained. 

TL;DR Every family and situation is different, co-sleeper and bed sharing got us to 6 months safely within the context of our family unit.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/8uvq8o/dad_tips/e3oda8c/,,Dad tips

comment,,2018-08-30 10:07:51,"Actually in Germany there is a big campaign about SIDS with the following guidelines:

* should sleep in own bed but in parents bedroom
* should sleep on its back
* no stuffed animals, cushions or basically anything soft in the bed
* sleeping bag, not blanket and cushion
* 16-18°C room temperature
* no smoking (ideally everywhere but at least in the bedroom)

We had such a sidecar bed and it was awesome for us. The little one initially didn't move that much while sleeping so she tended to stay in there. On the other hand she insisted on sleeping on her belly and we chose to accept that as we had all other recommendations covered. And as soon as she learned to roll over herself that one is out the window anyways.

Around six months old she was moving so much in her sleep that we decided to let her sleep in her own bed in her own room. She took her naps there anyways so it wasn't such a big change for her. Also she slept way better in a quiet room and with a babyphone directly besides her bed we knew when she was up or asleep.

My biggest gripe with SIDS stuff is that it is incredibly hard to do your own research. It's nigh impossible to correctly separate the individual issues and risks. Finally I found a great piece by a German doctor who discussed the problems you have with doing the actual studies. All studies have to rely on questionnaires filled out by grieving parents. So the data basis is skewed in the first place, especially once mistakes on the parent side are involved, such as drugs (alcohol, weed, whatever). Also many studies didn't do clean separations. He also referenced what /u/MBP_battery_king wrote, cosleeping becomes an issue once intoxication comes into play or once you fall asleep in a sitting position with the kid upon you. Many cases with the keyword cosleeping also had intoxication or outside of bed or non-parent person (babysitter, family friend or similar) as well but some studies just see that they all have cosleeping so that must be the issue. And as a normal non-science person you typically don't have access to the actual data so you can't interpret it yourself.

In the end the risk is already incredibly low, for example in Germany there were 164 SIDS cases in 2010. From 677947 births overall. That's 0,02% or 24 in 100000.

Don't do drugs once you have kids and let them always sleep in a bed with ventilation should already be a great step. Some people need fixed guidelines like the campaign here. For us it was a little unnerving because you start to question your guts and your baby's behaviour because you can't find conclusive data about the issue at all.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/8uvq8o/dad_tips/e5331cs/,,Dad tips

comment,,2018-08-30 10:58:55,"I have just looked at my search history but I can't find the article anymore. Also I wasn't able to actually find any data (even back then).

It was more that the article described how the interpretation of data differs which made sense to me so I was more content with the situation we had at hand.

A friend of mine got a sensor-mat from their family that you can put below the mattress and that will sound an alarm if it detects no more breathing movement but they refused to use it. He said they would probably worry more if the thing does actually work than they worry about SIDS. Also imagine that thing sounding an alarm some day just because the sensor isn't good enough. You'll be scared shitless.

Numbers are so low by now (I read that Germany had over 1200 cases in 1991 and they went down to about 150) that we decided not to worry about it. A main factor they did inform parents about were sleeping bags and sleeping on the back. The rest was added later on, as far as I could see.

post,Toronto was amazing!,2024-09-09 06:12:30,"I’m not sure if this is the right place for this post but I can simply post it elsewhere if it’s not allowed.

Anyway… I live in the US in a major city. I was here for 3 days and I don’t have anything negative to say about Toronto. It’s my first time in Canada. I plan to explore Alberta, specifically Banff National Park next summer. Here are some things I notice.. feel free to correct me on my observations. 

1. People are quiet! Hear me out, I am walking around the city, see groups of people and it’s still quiet. I notice you all speak low. I know some of you may laugh at this but it’s cool 😂 I loved how peaceful, calm and relaxed everyone was. There was an angry drunk lady attempting to cuss out a group of woman walking by but she was so passive about it. How can you cuss out someone and sound so calm and soft spoken 😂

2. The traffic and road rage was calm. Yeah I hear horns honking but I never seen someone open their window sticking up the middle finger. Nor did I hear the horns constantly like I would in major US cities. It was really odd… in a good way lol. There was traffic but it moved steadily. The buses weren’t loud either. 

3. It’s very clean. The city didn’t reek of a piss smell and trash. I’m aware weed is legal but I barely smelled it. I’m so used to weed legal cities having that strong smell or people smoking it right in your face. I don’t have an issue with weed but that observation caught me off guard. 

4. There is so much food! I wish I had more time to explore but the food was great. My only gripe is the Poutine I tried. I don’t think the particular restaurant I went to was a good choice for this dish. 

5. I notice a lot of people keep to themselves. It’s not in a rude manner but just in their own zone I guess. The dogs are well mannered too 😩 My dog wouldn’t know how to act in this city lol. 

Overall, Toronto treated me well! I will be back one day. I went by myself and I felt so free. I didn’t feel judged at all. In fact, I was in desperate need of a laid back vacation and Toronto was perfect for me. It wasn’t chaotic at all. 

I’ve always been fascinated with Canada for some reason. It did not disappoint ",207,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1fcgw1v/toronto_was_amazing/,low-traffic zones,

""Major! Major, Captain Hotexak needs you,"" the PFC said, running up. He sounded out of breath, even in his power assist armor. He stopped next to the sole officer wearing heavy power armor done in white and gold, with heavy inlay and embossed runes and sigils. Unlike the other officers, who all carried the standard Confederate Armed Services magac rifle, the officer in white carried a heavy submachinegun on his hip and had an inlaid and enameled M318 autocannon in storage position.

""Major?"" the PFC asked, tapping the officer with a comlink ping rather than physically touching him.

Vuxten jerked slightly, turning and looking at the PFC. He had been busy looking over the deployment orders for the entire battalion. He had only finished his Captain's tour a little over three months ago and had only graduated the Major's Command Course two weeks before the drop landing.

Unfortunately, Vuxten had slowly come to realize that while at first glance he was being promoted at the standard ""with waiver"" rate, he seemed to get immediate class availability, get all his waivers, and recommended for promotion at the first board that oversaw promotions.

Which meant, it was starting to feel political to Vuxten.

Which had left a slight sour tang of distaste in Vuxten's mouth.

His wife had told him that it would be a political concern if he was passed over, and she had rejected Vuxten's argument that he shouldn't receive waivers for time in grade and time in service, in order to get the minimum of both, as it was unfair to other troops as well as didn't give him time to get enough experience in the position, set a bad example.

But none of that mattered now. Fifth Telkan Marine Division was on the ground, backing up the  Fifty Seventh Corps as part of 22nd Army in the invasion of eight different systems, 57th Corps' part in the Iron Piglet Counter-Offensive.

Which meant there was no time for doubts and fears.

""Yes, Private?"" Vuxten asked, turning around, making sure one hand stayed on the lower part of the Madame 318 gunnery frame.

""Captain Hotexak needs you,"" the PFC said. ""He's in with Colonel Dartrum and General Twargark is on the commo band.""

""All right. Carry on, Private,"" Vuxten said. ""If you'll excuse me,"" he said to the men he was with, mostly experienced NCO's going over things they didn't need him to stand there and oversee.

He just felt strange not leading a company from the front or at least just being at company level as he had for the months since he'd returned from...

from...

He tried not to think about it too much.

But the way people glanced at his armor and weapons, the way he could see the white enamel and gold filigree and inlay on his armor and weapons, kept him from being able to put it behind him with ease.

""What do you think the Captain wants?"" Vuxten asked the one person he had around who knew what it was like having your life so radically and fundamentally altered.

\--lost his head can't find it needs superior officer help-- 471/Inertia sent back over the suit link, accompanied by several snickering emojis and a meme of a Captain with his head in a fishtank going ""Sir, sir, I can't seem to breathe!"" while a frustrated and angry looking Major stared at him.

Vuxten chuckled. ""Thanks, I needed that.""

He heard whispers again and shook his head. He'd been to the medics twice, but there was no reason for the whispers.

The tent was coming up, covered in camouflage netting, a sparkling em-field, as well as the odd crystalline distortions in mid-air from the temporal and spacial stabilizer systems.

Still didn't help with whatever the Slorpies did to wipe out most the communication bands.

The two tent guards both nodded and Vuxten moved in, sighing when the creation engine of the Madame 318 thumped against a box and audibly snarled at it.

A female Telkan's voice whispered in his ear for a moment, but he couldn't hear it plainly. He shook his head and moved into the room, undoing the smart-harness and setting the Madame Three-Eighteen down on a table.

Several Telkan were gathered up around a holotank, which was hooked into the ground laid fiber-optic cable communication system. Several other officers, all with their ranks and position on labels underneath them, were in the holofield too.

Without saying anything, Vuxten moved up, nodded to the gathered officers, nodded to the ones in the holotank, and stared at data being displayed in the holotank.

The initial landings had gone well. They'd hit the system, the Task Force had deployed the system munitions, and everything had gone according to the warplan. Fifth Telkan Marine Division had made planetfall, straight into the zones. Forward operations bases, logistics bases, all had been established within hours of landing into enemy fire.

The lines had pushed out from the FOB's, linking together, establishing air superiority, counter-battery superiority, even wet navy launches.

The Atrekna had obviously been caught by surprise for the first sixty hours.

But they weren't surprised any longer and they had a vested interest in winning.

Now, it was a complete shitshow.

The holotank showed it plainly.

The lines were firm, spreading out from the quickly established LZ's for the second wave,

""How bad?"" Vuxten asked the Captain next to him.

Someone whispered in his non-cybernetic ear.

""Pretty bad, sir,"" the Telkan Marine Captain said, the earlier nervousness of being around a living legend having vanished under the heavy action of the last few days. He reached out and scrolled through the data windows until he popped open a drone feed.

It was a highway, full of cars, hovercraft that were still controlled by the traffic controller systems, and lines of people walking.

One Lanaktallan was galloping down the median wearing LawSec armor with ""FREE HERD"" spraypainted on it. The Lanaktallan had several children on his back and a flank-sash with two boxes attached, one on each side of his lower torso, filled with what looked like tiny children. He was obviously running almost past his endurance, his tongue hanging out, his eyes wild.

A gun in each of his four hands.

He wasn't the only one, but for a long second, he was the one that Vuxten's eyes were locked onto.

He could almost hear the scene provided by the stealth drone.

""Cities were full of refugees, of prisoner camps that the locals are claiming were larders for the Atrekna rulership caste,"" Captain Hotexak said. ""This morning, counter-battery artillery flattened a large section of those biobugs and a few air strikes softened up the reinforcements, and that's when it happened.""

""What?"" Vuxten asked, swallowing and trying to concentrate.

Everyone was staring at him.

To be honest, it felt weird. The two higher ranking officers had decades of experience under their belt and they were all staring at him like he was about to perform a magic trick and awe everyone.

""The prisoners staged a breakout with the help of what appears to be an insurgency,"" General Twargark said, her voice low and musical. She rubbed her shoulder, the muscles on her arm bulging. Her finger tapped the icon of the Lanaktallan who had stopped, gasping, leaning on a car. There was a dead insect creature at his feet and his pistols were smoking. ""They're wearing LawSec and CorpSec armor and carrying a hodgepodge of weapons, none of which have been too effective, but they're making up for their lack of tech edge with sheer grit.""

The Lanaktallan straightened up, his chest and lower torso still heaving, and began trotting forward.

""They're streaming out of the cities by the tens, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions,"" Colonel Dartrum said. ""Heading all for our lines.""

""And we don't have the infrastructure to help them,"" Vuxten guessed.

""As you can see, we can't provide any support beyond the odd close air support,"" General Twargark said. She tapped a representation of the battle lines. ""If we shift troops to give them ground support, it'll pull troops off the line. The Atrekna are mysteriously inactive since the POW camps broke free.""

""They want us to shift to protect the civilians,"" Vuxten guessed. He closed his eyes. *Legion's beard, I hate this.*

\*""\*Intel figures that they're banking on us going to the civilians assistance. The refugee lines are as long as thirty miles in some places,"" Captain Hotexak said. He tapped another window and it expanded. ""The traffic computers work, and are on martial law setting, which means the only vehicles that can override them are military vehicles, all the way up to here,"" he pointed at the window.

Five miles from the lines there was rubble and wreckage and a dead Ohm Class bioweapon cutting off the road. Refugees were abandoning vehicles and walking, streaming around the wreckage.

All heading for the Confederate lines.

""Eighteen different cities, all across the front, we've got millions of refugees and insurgents heading for our lines. The Atrekna are hitting them just enough to keep them panicked, kill some with the Dwellerspawn that are, well, messy. They're trying to force us to redeploy,"" the General said.

Vuxten sighed again, this time with relief, when his stimgum ration reset enough for him to tab up another piece of gum.

It made the whispers recede.

\--double plus ungood-- 471 said.

Vuxten just triggered an agreement emoji back.

""This is new,"" Vuxten said. He leaned forward and watched as a large insect creature ran down the line of cars, smashing at the tops and at the front ends, where the cargo space was. It dented the body up, shattered windows, screeched at the occupants, then ran into the field, ducking down and crawling on all its limbs almost as fast as it ran on its bigger legs.

""That's not a probing attack or anything other than hitting their morale and causing fear,"" Vuxten said.

The others all nodded. ""Intel concurs.""

Vuxten closed his eyes again and focused himself.

*be with me now* the whisper was the first plain one he had heard.

Vuxten reached down, his hands finding the firing lever and the stabilization bar on Madame Three-Eighteen. He squeezed tightly, feeling the pressure sleeve in his gauntlet squish under his fingers.

""Uh, Major?"" he heard from a far distance.

*I beseech you to walk with me*

*in my darkest moment, please be with me*

*look after the podlings*

*lay thy hand upon the squirmlings*

*be with the children now as I try, all I can do is try, but please be with them*

""Major?"" the voice seemed even further.

*be with us, as e=mc2 and t=d/s and ms\^2 are our guides*

*be with the children*

*be with them, please*

*hear my prayers*

*hear my words*

*hear my pleas*

*help me*

*help us*

*help them*

*help*

*Help*

*HELP*

***HELP!***

He felt it. The pounding rage. The wrath. It boiled up out of his core, where Lady Keena had taught him to lock it away, to temper it into steel.

Instead it was a boiling fire that rolled out of that tiny black spot that had just cracked and ruptured, under too much pressure to hold.

It filled his mind, filled his very being, filled his *soul.*

*PLEASE, SAINT VUXTEN, GIVE ME COURAGE JUST FOR ONE LAST MOMENT!*

He could feel a dozen, a hundred, a thousand pleading hands reaching out to him.

It felt to Vuxten like the entire world was made of white fire.

""I am with you,"" Vuxten whispered.

Everything went blue-white.

\--INERTIA IS WITH YOU-- he heard screamed over the comlink.

Captain Hotexak stared at where just a moment before one of the most famous Telkan in existence had stood.

He looked around.

""Where is he? Where did he go?"" Captain Hotexak asked.

""Find him! Lock onto his transponder!"" the General snapped.

Vuxten felt his boots hit the ground and opened his eyes.

The Dwellerspawn were everywhere, chasing civilians, that screamed and ran. They streamed out of moss and vine covered buildings, clutching infants and children of all races and species, crying, screaming, blinking at the sunlight as they crashed through open doorways and empty windowframes.

The Dwellerspawn were screaming.

He could feel the cold approval and enjoyment of the Atrekna.

""NO MORE!"" he roared out.

He shifted his thumb and saw the icon for Madame Three-Eighteen go from safe to dangerous.

""NO MORE!"" his speakers vibrated with his rage.

He aimed the weapon.

He could see the Atrekna clearly, their tight clustered groups of two and three surrounded by a fairy dust sprinkling of clear prisms.

""NO MORE PODLING BLOOD!""

He squeezed the firing lever.

How would you maintain moral, professionalism and discipline when you have one of the most famous people in the universe under your command? If you even ask him something as trivial as if he prefers glazed or unglazed donuts, you'll cause a supply problem and create a minor religious enclave ""The Donut of Truth"" or some such nonsense. 

I wonder how Elvis Presly's command staff dealt with that. 

Oh, and I suppose the british military has a lot to say on this topic, since they have a lot of experience with Royals serving, and seem to have figured out how to manage such a situation. 

Also, Vux is being too hard on himself. After all the accelerated time in service while on Hestla, as well as experience gained during the WOH. Someone has got to remind that boy he has more than earned his brass.

#What is World of Warcraft?

While I’m sure almost everyone has at least *some* idea of what WoW is, I’ll give a little overview. World of Warcraft is an MMORPG developed by Blizzard Entertainment – a fantasy game which takes place in the colossal online world of Azeroth, where players can quest, fight, and interact with other players. There are two factions – the Horde and the Alliance – each had separate playable races, separate cities, economies, questlines, politics, backstories, and attitudes. The factions acted as the cornerstone for the game’s PvP.

WoW was an immediate hit when it first came out in November 2004. It followed on the heels of games like Everquest and Ultima Online, but completely reinvented the formula, with more player conveniences, far greater variety, graphical fidelity, and storytelling. It was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stagnating genre, and went on to dominate the MMORPG genre for two decades. [Here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXVMGNQx6G8) is a video beginner’s guide to those who need it.

EDIT: [Here's a great video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHQE0ILci4o) which came out just after this series ended which gives a good introduction to the history of WoW.

#Part 1 - Beta and Vanilla

‘Vanilla’ is the term players use to refer to the game upon its release. The game was unpolished, its community a wild west where anything went. The rules and expectations of MMORPGs hadn’t really been figured out yet, and so this is when a lot of WoW’s strangest dramas took place. We won’t be touching crazes like [the hilarious Onyxia Wipe]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TAr0VNks20) or [Leeroy Jenkins]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a40) or [The Talisman of Binding Shard]( https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Talisman_of_Binding_Shard), because there isn’t really enough meat on the bones there. But they’re fun to go back to anyway.  

#The Goldshire Inn

TW: Sexual abuse, Rape, Pedophilia

Let’s jump right in at the deep end.

From the start, one of WoW’s most niche (and enduring) attractions has been roleplay. The dominant RP (Roleplay) servers are Moonguard (US) and Argent Dawn (EU), and it is in these communities that we lay our scene. Over the years, many areas and races would be added to the game, giving players loads of different options for where, how and who they could roleplay. But in WoW’s early days, one building would develop a reputation for which it still lives in infamy today. A picturesque little tavern in a snow-white esque woodland. [The Goldshire Inn](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5AE8S6XsAEFGXy.png).

One large aspect of RP is ERP (Erotic Role Play). After all, Roleplayers need love too. In case it wasn’t obvious, this is the process of meeting up with other players and roleplaying out sexual encounters. 

Dwarves and Gnomes don’t do it for most players (not everyone can appreciate the taste of fine wine), so many ERPers would create a human character (or recreate one with a different appearance/sex) to get their digital rocks off. New humans started in [Elwynn Forest]( https://wow.gamepressure.com/gfx/ingamemaps/7.jpg) at Northshire, and as you can see from the map, the nearest settlement is Goldshire. And Goldshire has an inn. With a bar, bedrooms, and a dark basement full of cobwebs. [You can see where this is going]( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fDuOwk_z9ZY/maxresdefault.jpg).

Goldshire Inn quickly became the hub of roleplay debauchery on WoW. [A hive of the blackest scum and villainy]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I05t9imkfb0). On a good evening, the inn heaved with the pixellated bosoms of naked women dancing on railings, the ‘thip thap thip thap’ of steps as players awkwardly move back and forth, clipping through each other’s bodies. Of course, not all of the roleplay falls into [what we would consider ‘legal’]( https://www.vice.com/en/article/mb7b9q/world-of-warcraft-has-a-rape-problem). There are plenty of adults roleplaying as children, children roleplaying as adults, abuse, bondage, rape, vore, furry, scat – [no matter what you’re into]( https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1506006891318-RapeTaverne2.jpeg?resize=600:*), there’s always someone at Goldshire who shares your degenerate sexual proclivities. 

&gt; The dwarf chases after an orc who runs through the inn with his snow cannon. Seconds later, a chat window pops up: ""You horny? What's your number?"" Those who spend time in the tavern quickly run into various characters, such as the night elves, who scurry across the screen in their lingerie, intensely eyeing them before announcing in all caps: ""I'm going to fuck you unconscious!""

Various Addons have been created which allow players to create RP profiles, detailing everything about them from age to gender to height to their no-doubt tragic backstories. But these profiles are only visible to other people with the Addon. So there’s often an entire subtextual layer beneath the obvious roleplay, only visible to those in the know. 

There’s a slight problem here, however. Humans are the most popular race for first-time players, and for many of them, [their first interaction with the greater WoW community is at Goldshire]( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4hwhwx/why_is_goldshire_inn_in_argent_dawn_filled_with/). There are even important quests which force them into the inn, where they are bombarded with booties and breasts, whispered offers of sexual bliss, and confronted with sights that will stay with them forever. This has resulted in a lot of scarred psyches and a lot of awakened fetishes over the years.

Aside from the obvious memes and jokes, Goldshire Inn has provoked discussions of [ditigal consent]( https://mashable.com/article/rape-tavern-erotic-roleplaying-world-warcraft-sex), and child safety online. WoW has a minimum age rating of 12 and is available for free until level 20. For some ERPers, chasing and hunting down non-consenting players across the game-world is part of the fun. For others, they try to move the situation out of the game ASAP, offering to exchange pictures, meet up, or do video calls. In 2010, [Blizzard announced it would ‘patrol’ Goldshire Inn]( https://www.tomshardware.com/news/World-of-Warcraft-MMO-MMORPG,11020.html) and sanction players who infringed upon community guidelines, but that never seemed to do much.
 
&gt; ""It was supposed to be a nice evening. I created a mage and went straight to Goldshire. The tavern was packed. All the guests were wearing either fancy costumes or nothing at all. I've never seen so many purple breasts. I thought I'd landed in a real sex club,"" Klara said.

&gt;  ""A female human really wanted to 69 with me as a few paladins watch and simulate ejaculation through spells that emit white light.""

As the old saying goes, what happens in Goldshire stays in Goldshire. 

#The Warrior Indalamar

[This is actually a story from WoW’s beta]( https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Indalamar), but I’m including it here. 

For WoW’s entire lifespan, it would see disputes, jokes, and complaints over which class is overpowered and which is underpowered. Before the game, one thing was certain – Warriors were the worst. A lot of players avoided them entirely, and refused to group up with them because they were so ineffective in battle. There were widespread demands for them to be buffed (made more powerful).

But there was one man who sought to prove that Warriors weren’t so bad after all. This was Indalamar. He went against the consensus, insisting that Warriors were, if anything, overpowered. No one believed him. So he posted a video which tore through the community like wildfire.

[In the video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibh4SO5W4OU), Andalamar ran around, downing enemies one after another in two hits or less. It turned out, the Warrior’s abilities held a power that no one had worked out yet. It all had to do with an ability called Bloodthirst – it became active after killing an enemy, and dramatically raised the damage of the next strike. As soon as you hit the next enemy, you would deal massive damage and raise your haste (attack speed) by 35%. The enemy would die almost immediately, activating Bloodthirst for the next enemy, and the next. 

Indalamar had been right. Warriors hadn’t been weak, they’d been the strongest class in the game. But before the video had even finished making the rounds, Blizzard nerfed them. The fact that a player had singlehandedly forced Blizzard to change the game made him a household name in the community, beloved by some and hated by others (mostly other Warriors). In fact, he received huge amounts of abuse online from players who felt he had made an already weak class even weaker.

But this story has a happy ending. Indalamar was hired by Blizzard, and they have paid homage to him a number of times. [He had his own card in the WoW Trading Card Game]( http://www.blogcdn.com/wow.joystiq.com/media/2011/05/azindalamar.jpg), and his own item in a raid named [‘Ramaladni’s Blade of Culling’](https://www.wowhead.com/item=50798/ramaladnis-blade-of-culling) (Ramaladni is, of course, Indalamar backwards).

To this day, Indalamar is a legend among WoW players. He was one of the first to reach the heights of stardom – but he would not be the last. 

#The Suicide Scandal

We’ll continue our morbid theme with a particularly upsetting story from China. The Chinese relationship with World of Warcraft is long and complicated, and I’ll be returning to it periodically throughout this post. Perhaps this event is an omen of things to come. 

On 27 December 2004, [a thirteen year high school student named Zhang Xiaoyi]( https://ganker.com/world-of-warcraft-blamed-for-child-jumping-off-building-and-dying/) logged onto his night elf and said his goodbyes to his fellow players. Then he leapt from a 24-storey window in Tianjin. He had just played World of Warcraft for a 36 consecutive hours. Players were quick to link his suicide to the trend of WoW Basejumping, in which characters jump off tall buildings or natural features and compete to see how far they can fall without dying. His suicide note said he wanted to join the heroes of the game, and he left behind a diary in which he obsessed over it day and night. The hospital in Beijing where Zhang was declared dead had this to say:

&gt; ""Zhang had excessively indulged in unhealthy games and was addicted to the Internet.""

[Zhang’s parents sued Blizzard]( http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-05/12/content_588456.htm) at Chaoyang District People’s Court in Beijing, requesting 100,000 yuan ($12,500) in compensation, which seems a paltry amount. They claimed the game was inappropriate for young people, due to the way it trapped them in a cycle of addiction, and they called for a warning label to be added to WoW’s marketing and packaging which said ‘Playing games excessively can harm health’. At the time, a report issued by the China Youth Association for Internet Development stated that up to 13.2% of young people were addicted to computers. 

The incident led to [a massive outcry]( https://www.foxnews.com/story/chinese-warcraft-game-distributor-sued-over-teens-suicide), both in the West and China, about the potentially harmful effects of video games. At the time, China had no age ratings like the US, where WoW was rated ‘T for Teen’. Zhang Chunliang, a Chinese expert on game addiction, called for ratings to be established.

&gt;Many foreign countries have established strict game classification systems to help parents determine which games are suitable for their children. China should also establish such a system.""

The Chinese government refused. Several attempts have been made to push a ratings system, first in 2004 by the Chinese Consumer Association, then again by the Communist Youth League in China, then again in 2010 by the Institute for Cultural Industries, then again in 2011, then again in 2019. [Critics accuse China of being too covetous over control.]( https://www.protocol.com/china/china-game-rating)

&gt;""The government is not willing to let go of the [market] control,"" Zhang Chundi, gaming analyst at London-based research firm Ampere Analysis, told Protocol. He explained that most rating systems involve an industry association that designated age-based labels for games, but Chinese regulators are wary of transferring such power to a private organization.

This was WoW’s first taste of the dangers of video game addiction – and it was one of China’s too. But it was really just the start. World of Warcraft would go on to shape the conversation on video game addiction for years to come. It was [compared to crack cocaine]( https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/4863325/World-of-Warcraft-more-addictive-than-cocaine.html) and overplaying has been associated with numerous [health issues]( https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2977817/Video-game-fan-coughs-blood-drops-dead-Shanghai-internet-caf-playing-World-Warcraft-straight-19-hours.html). In June 2018, the World Health Organisation listed “gaming disorder” as a disease which impairs control and causes victims to lose interest in other daily activities or hobbies. 

China would go on to create multiple laws combatting video game addiction, from [limiting how long minors can play games]( https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-50315960), to [banning all games on school days]( https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/30/business/media/china-online-games.html). They would even instate [military-style boot camps]( https://www.motherjones.com/media/2015/06/chinese-internet-addiction-center-photos/) to break video game addictions. 

Critics of these laws have called them authoriarian, and insisted that it is a parent’s responsibility to control their childrens’ access to online games. Many have pointed out that video game addiction is often not a disease, but is rather a symptom of other issues, and tackling these issues should be the main priority. 

To most, this seemed like a non-issue. What kind of idiot would get addicted to an online game?

They would change their tune soon enough.

#The Million Gnome March

Time to lighten things up a bit. 

This was one of WoW’s strangest dramas. Just two months after the release of the game Blizzard was still making drastic changes left and right to the balance of the classes. Players were eager to make their opinions known, because any change, however bad, could be the one Blizzard chose to stick with. But WoW had a huge playerbase, even then, and it took a lot to get Blizzard’s attention. Not everyone was an Indalamar. 

[Only collective action would do.]( https://games.slashdot.org/story/05/02/01/2235255/the-million-gnome-march)

[The date was 29th January 2005]( https://afkgamer.com/archives/2005/01/27/they-will-overcome/). It was a Friday evening on the server Argent Dawn, and the [halls of Ironforge]( https://wow.gamepressure.com/gfx/maps/43.jpg) were bustling with players, all of them still new to the game, excitedly trading, looking for groups to tackle dungeons, discussing what new features might be on the way, and roleplaying in what would go on to become the game’s biggest RP server. Perhaps some of them knew about the thunderous anger boiling away on the official forums about nerfs to Warriors, but to the ignorant masses, what happened next came as a total surprise. 

A few level one gnomes waddled through the [city’s colossal gate]( https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/79920-ironforge.jpg). That in itself wasn’t weird. But then a half dozen more followed. And a dozen after that. And then a hundred. And then a thousand. [The gnomes kept coming]( https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qIrRWH.XVSYQ1f.Tl0Ftkg--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTQwNzt3PTY3NTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AXEVWyQhRlE8JbU_.hwWcA--~B/aD0zNTA7dz01ODA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/28897bee772294c12b29ce66f67b3cb7/200891248/protest+gnomes.gif.cf.jpg), rushing through the [Commons]( https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/blog_header/8o/8O1A97BC3B7K1569342314291.jpg) in a [fleshy, knee-high torrent]( https://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/50459cb1b2304252873c1af7e2412f25/200891260/protest+gnomes+2.gif) of pigtails and low-quality shields. Most of them were naked. In the words of one witness:

&gt;”I cannot adequately describe how horrifying a vision that is.” Said one liveblogger

Ironforge was the main hub for Alliance players at the time, so they were welcomed by an audience of hundreds, which swelled uncontrollably as they were joined by other onlookers who wanted to see what all the fuss was about, and possibly join in the gnomery for themselves – first it was members of the Horde on Argent Dawn, then players from other servers. Nothing like this had ever been done before. Some of the locals demanded the protesters go protest somewhere else, and were presumably rewarded for their humbuggery with some nasty headbuts to the shins. But the Million Gnome March could not be stopped. 

[It began to hit critical mass.]( https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66dd4a_9aee3bc1c82e4873958ef914a274c4ba~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_468,h_502,al_c/66dd4a_9aee3bc1c82e4873958ef914a274c4ba~mv2.png)

The servers started to lag, players started falling through the world or being knocked out of the game. WoW couldn’t keep up. The Argent Dawn server was great at processing industrial amounts of elaborately emoted porn, but it had never handled crowds like this. 

Xanan appeared at the gates. He was a GM – a Game Master. They were WoW’s in-game moderators, reachable only through a reporting tool. To see one in person was an anomaly. It never happened. But the protest had called and Blizzard had answered.

&gt;""omg omg, there's an actual GM character here now in Ironforge near the bridge,"" he wrote. ""In 50-some levels, I have never seen an actual GM character EVER in this game.”

But Blizzard wasn’t there to parley. Xanan’s first request was polite. ""This is severely impacting other players' gaming experiences. Please be advised failure to disperse can result in disciplinary action."" He said, to much derision. The gnomes refused. They would not be moved. The revolution had come and they would rather die on their adorable little feet than live as slaves. 

Meanwhile, Argent Dawn continued collapsing around them, to the point where many protesters couldn’t leave even if they wanted to. Blizzard manually restarted the server, knocking everyone offline, but they were back the moment turned on again. Xanan made one final warning.

&gt; Attention: Gathering on a realm with intent to hinder gameplay is considered griefing and will not be tolerated. If you are here for the Warrior protest, please log off and return to playing on your usual realm.


&gt;We appreciate your opinion, but protesting in game is not a valid way to give us feedback. Please post your feedback on the forums instead. If you do not comply, we will begin taking action against accounts.


&gt;Please leave this area if you are here to disrupt game play (sic) as we are suspending all accounts.

[Shit had gotten real.]( https://afkgamer.com/archives/2005/01/28/the-gnome-tea-party/) A large swathe of protesters took this as acknowledgement of their goals, and logged off before the ban hammer started falling. Argent Dawn locals fled Ironforge in droves. And in a moment of uncompromising brutality that would foreshadow Blizzard’s treatment of protesters and unions for years to come, the suspensions began. The length of the bans varied from a few hours to multiple days, but the end result was the same. A desolated Ironforge.

The Gnomes had fallen. 

They vented their anger on the forums once again, but the Million Gnome March had ironically pushed the plight of Warriors to the side. There was a far bigger debate going on now – [the rights of players to assemble online, virtual protests, synthetic statehood]( https://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2005/02/the_right_to_as.html) and the ethics of Blizzard’s response. For its part, Blizzard claimed it had taken necessary action to protect its servers and to keep Argent Dawn running, and that repeating the protest would result in permanent bans. Did that make it acceptable? The protesters pointed out that disrupting society was the entire point of collective action. It was designed to force higher powers to pay attention. 

Much like the issue of Goldshire Inn, [people were beginning to realise that online worlds often the same political dilemmas as the real world, but unlike the real world, there were no protections or guidelines in place. These were lawless lands. Years would pass before governments truly began to create and enforce policy on how people and companies can act online. 

In the end, Warriors remained weak. Game Designer Tom Chilton wrote a *totally separate* post about the virtues of Warriors and their unique abilities, but outlined no plans to change them. 
[Players had wide-ranging opinions on the protest.]( https://wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=21&amp;mid=110729981024201161#3) 

&gt; MMOGs are suppose to be virtual playgrounds, or at least that was the original ideal. However Blizzard doesn't seem to be able to handle that kind of abstract thinking. 

Others condemned the protest

&gt; Blizzard does the right thing by breaking up the congregation and sending people away to reduce lag. It's not like the CEO and his cronies are sitting around Dun Murogh waiting to be impressed by your 'show of solidarity', the only people who are noticing what's going on are the people who suddenly can't loot their kills, pick their herbs, etc. because the servers are starting to meltdown.

Another had this to say

&gt;  a MMORPG isn't a democracy. You do not have freedom of speech, you do not have the freedom to assemble. The Constitution does not apply to a virtual world that is owned by a company. The ToS you signed pretty much waive your rights in the real world.


&gt;Frankly, assembling a mass to cause lag and crash a server is an idiotic way to voice your opinions. There are the forums, there is email, there are phone numbers, and there is the allmighty credit card you use to make your payments. 

Boing Boing’s Cory Doctorow put it best

&gt;...real life has one gigantic advantage over gamelife. In real life, you can be a citizen with rights. In gamelife, you're a customer with a license agreement. In real life, if a cop or a judge just makes up a nonsensical or capricious interpretation of the law, you can demand an appeal. In gamelife, you can cancel your contract, or suck it up.

Regardless of ethics or effectiveness, many protests would follow throughout WoW’s long history. From the Druids United protests to 2021 Stormwind Sit-in. When all else had failed, players would always return to collective action.

#The Menethil Ganker

This is one of my absolute favourite stories from WoW. Legend tells of an orc Rogue who crippled his server for months in early 2005, [slaughtering anyone foolish]( https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/meet-world-of-warcrafts-most-notorious-ganker/) enough to step into his domain. His name was Angwe, and the server was Decethus (PvP). 

At this time, Azeroth was made up of two great continents, [Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms]( https://overgear.com/guides/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/boat-routes-alliance.jpg). There were only a few ways of getting between them. Members of the Mage class could teleport, Warlocks could summon, and all players had a hearthstone which would take them back to a place of their choosing, though it had a long cooldown. But the bulk of player traffic went by the ships, which would round-robin back and forth from select points. On the Eastern Kingdoms, your options were [Booty Bay]( https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/ee/Booty_Bay_%28Post_Cata%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200806065412) in the south, or [Menethil Harbour]( https://classic-wow-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Menethil_Harbor?file=Menethil_Harbor.jpg) in the Wetlands (just above Ironforge on the map I linked). 

Since it linked to two of the three routes, Menethil was the pressure point of the game world. He who controlled the Harbour controlled the world (of warcraft). 

Enter Angwe. He spotted a part of the zone leading to Menethil which bottlenecked players, and slaughtered every Allaince player who tried to pass through. He controlled the path day and night in his determination to stop anyone from reaching the harbour. 

Angwe quickly rose into infamy, receiving more threats, insults and accusations than most people could imagine, but they only made him more determined. In fact, he [lovingly collected them]( http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/) to preserve for future generations. That site has literally hundreds of messages.

Players speculated on when he [might sleep, or work, or do anything]( http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/e34.jpg) other than massacring noobs. [They wrote extensive guides on the alternatives to going through the pass]( http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/antiangwe.jpg), such as sneaking under the water along the coast or creating sacrificial clones to distract him. In some cases, max level players would organise convoys to shepherd groups of newer players through the pass. Large groups of PvPers charged the bottleneck to wipe him out, but as a Rogue, he could simply disappear from sight, waiting for individuals to break away from the pack so that he could pick them off one by one. A particularly intrepid sore-loser tried to doxx Angwe but only ended up with his girlfriend’s name – so they assumed he was a woman (because he couldn’t possibly have a girlfriend).  

But Angwe was one step ahead of them. He created an Alliance character, inconspicuously named ‘Angwespy’, and used it to monitor his enemies, or taunt them after death. He infiltrated the forums of major guilds in order to intercept their comms. 

But where some men see ruin, others see opportunity. Players [approached Angwe]( http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/g12.jpg) with offers of gold if he agreed to gank certain other players. To many, he was a [celebrity]( http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/g14.jpg) with near [mythical status]( http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/g15.jpg).

&gt;[Ancience] whispers: Can’t we make some sort of agreement, so that you can at least stop killing me? Gold? Armour? Exp? Something?

&gt;[Angwe] whispers: no

 In October 2012, Angwe held an AMA, in which he finally revealed his secrets. 

&gt; It was just me, typically 8-10 hours a day. I didn't raid, level alts and only rarely did dungeons after 60. My goal was to get on average 100 honor kills in a day (this was before battlegrounds), which would put me either 1st or 2nd place weekly in the honor grind.

For context, an ‘honor kill’ is a reward for killing a player of the same level. Of course, Angwe would also kill any low level players passing by ‘to kill the time’, even if he didn’t get anything for it. Good murder is its own reward.

In 2006, the iconic South Park episode [‘Make Love Not Warcraft’]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLqqKbti48o) released, and while nothing has been publicly confirmed, there are those who speculate that the episode is based on Angwe’s reign of terror. 

&gt;""All the lowbies would wait back there, and I'd usually be fighting whoever is trying to kill me to get on the boat,"" Angwe explains. ""And as soon as I'd die or whatever, you'd see a flood of people run for the boat. Even if the boat came [and I was still alive], they'd just try to get on the fucking boat. A lot of times, the goal wasn't to kill people at that point. I just wanted to make sure none of these fuckers made it toward the boat. If they did, everyone would lose interest in being there and I wouldn't be able to kill anybody anymore.""

Ultimately, it was not boredom that killed off Angwe, or defeat by combat. It was Blizzard. They introduced the new ‘Battlegrounds’ feature, which allowed players to fight in separate arenas. To get to a battleground, you had to go to its physical entrance, and the most popular of these was Alterac Valley – just north of Menethil Harbour. As a result, this once-remote zone was now throning with high level PvPers at all times of the day. 

Angwe has spoken out many times over the years. After Battlegrounds dropped, he left the game and went to study game design. He now works as a programmer for MMOs, but does not play them himself.

#The Kazzak Massacre

One of the highest level zones in the game was ‘Blasted Lands’. In order to give it a sense of danger, Blizzard like to place extremely powerful bosses in questing areas and make them walk around, so that players were forced to be wary of their surroundings. [One such boss was Lord Kazzak](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=12397/lord-kazzak#comments). 

Normally, it took forty max-level players to defeat Kazzak. He had many powerful abilities, including a shadowbolt attack that could hit anyone within a long range, as well as a skill called ‘Capture Soul’, which raised his health by 70,000 every time he killed. This meant that every player death made him considerably harder to defeat.

Due to how WoW’s combat worked, enemies could be kited. Kiting is when a player allows an enemy to attack them, holding onto that enemy’s attention, and gradually runs away, but never fast enough that the enemy stops chasing them. Through this trick, any enemy could be kited to any part of the map. And it just so happened that Kazzak’s little corner of the [Blasted Lands was tantalisingly close to Stormwind]( http://greywolf.critter.net/images/wow/maps/Travel-Map-EasternKingdoms-C.jpg) – one of the largest cities in the game.  

Kiting any boss to Stormwind would be an immense task, and Kazzak was no exception. Simply staying alive that long required entire groups working in unison. The trip from the Blasted Lands, up north through the Swamp of Sorrows, then across Dead Wind Pass, around Duskwood, and up into Elwynn Forest to Stormwind could take up to an hour, and Kazzak would continue unleashing fierce attacks the whole way.

But once he arrived at Stormwind’s pearly gates, a chain reaction took hold. The low level players amassed in the city were instantly swept away by his shadowbolt, and every one of them added 70,000hp to Kazzak. He was also able to kill NPCs, who would quickly respawn and die again and again. His health rapidly spiralled into the tens of millions, then the hundreds of millions, as he feasted on a never-ending supply of noobs.  A famous video from 6th March 2005 shows him wrecking the city and leaving devastation in his wake. 

[Kazzak was unstoppable]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0VWJdE01M). Once he reached Stormwind, he became an invulnerable wrecking machine. Corpses filled the streets. There was no-where to hide – Kazzak’s shadowbolts went through buildings. The only option was to flee for the safety of the woods. 

All seemed lost.

But those massacred players would come for Kazzak.

You see, Paladins had an ability called reckoning. After being the victim of a critical strike, their next attack hit twice. But this ability could be applied any number of times, without limit. If you got two critical strikes, your next hit would do 3x the damage, and so on. Players were quick to exploit this.

[All it took was two people - a Paladin and a friend]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsQWyfu02II). The two would duel, and the Paladin would sit down while their friend hit them over and over. Hitting a player while they’re sitting down guarantees a critical hit, which meant they could trigger Reckoning as many times as they wanted. The highest recorded number of Reckonings at once is 1800 – that takes hours. But at that point, your Reckoning Bomb could instantly kill any enemy in the game with a single hit. Any player, any monster, and any boss. 

Even Lord Kazzak. 

And to this day, this is to be the [only recorded way players were able to one-shot Kazzak]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xhgvouRprw). They never had a chance to try it out once he reached the city, because within 24 hours of the killing, the ability was nerfed.

But it wasn’t enough. Eventually, Lord Kazzak was removed from WoW, and Reckoning was nerfed. Blizzard began clamping down on the many ways players were able to exploit the game. 

#The Corrupted Blood

This particular incident began on 13 September 2005. Patch 1.7.0 had just released, and with it came [Zul’Gurub]( https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Zul%27Gurub), a 20-man raid into a troll infested jungle. The final boss went by the name ‘[Hakar the Soulflayer]( https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/e/e3/Hakkar2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/757?cb=20150723171013)’, and had a spell called ‘[Corrupted Blood]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident)’, which would inflict gradual damage to players, and spread to anyone within a certain radius. It disappeared from players who left the raid, and wasn’t meant to least more than a few seconds. But there was an oversight. 

The Hunter class are able to summon pets to fight for them in battle, and if a pet got afflicted with the Corrupted Blood and was dismissed, they would still have the curse when they were summoned again. Even if they were outside the raid.

The first outbreaks were accidental. Hunters brought out their pets in the game’s major cities, only for the Corrupted Blood to spread like wildfire, infecting everyone nearby. Low level players were almost immediately killed off by the plague as it ate away at their healthbars. Many never got the chance to flee – and those who did flee often simply created new outbreaks elsewhere. Before long, these curiosities had [developed into a full-blown pandemic]( https://www.wired.co.uk/article/world-of-warcraft-coronavirus-corrupted-blood). 

[Much like a real virus]( https://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18571), the Corrupted Blood was spread by animals. The NPCs could catch and spread the plague, but were almost impossible to kill, turning them effectively into asymptomatic carriers. [Skeletons began to pile up in the streets of Ironforge and Orgrimmar]( https://img.i-scmp.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=contain,width=1098,format=auto/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/2020/01/22/pasted_image_0_17.png?itok=00Wix8nt). Dying causes gear to degrade, which is expensive to fix, so many players fled the cities to find safety in the wilderness. Others fuelled the chaos, deliberately causing new outbreaks wherever they could. [These individuals were compared to biological terrorists]( https://blizzardwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pre-zombie-8.jpg). On the flipside, there were the ‘first responders’, who waded into the epicentres and attempted to heal the sick – though they often caught the Corrupted Blood themselves, and became spreaders in turn.

Many of WoW’s 2 million players would log on just to see what was happening (and then get infected), or log off to isolate themselves. The economy of the game totally shut down as the cities became ghost towns.  

[There were many parallels with how a real world virus would spread]( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6951918.stm). To the powerful, it was just an inconvenience, so they went about their daily routines, whereas to low-levelled players (comparable to the weak and elderly), it presented an incredible danger.

Blizzard tried to impose a quarantine rule on players to stop the spread, but many refused to obey or didn’t take it seriously. The last time anybody made a list of the top hundred character attributes of WoW players, common sense snuck in at number 79. In the end, it took several hard resets and patches to stop the spread. The virus was contained to Zul’Gurub on 8 October. 

Academics at Ben Gurion University in Israel published an article in the journal *Epidemiology* in March 2007, describing the similarities between the Corrupted Blood and SARS and avian flu.  The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention contacted Blizzard and requested statistics for research. One factor that simulations at the time did not consider was curiosity – players put themselves at risk to see what all the fuss was about, in the same way journalists might do in the real world. Nina Fefferman, a research professor of public health at Tufts University, co-authored a paper in the *Lancet Infectious Diseases* discusing the implications of the outbreak, and spoke out for MMOs to be used to simulate other real world issues. 

[It should come as no surprise that many people have compared the Corrupted Blood to Coronavirus.]( https://www.pcgamer.com/the-researchers-who-once-studied-wows-corrupted-blood-plague-are-now-fighting-the-coronavirus/) Epidemiologists used research from the incident to understand the spread of COVID-19, specifically how societies respond to these kinds of threats.

In a recent interview with PC Gamer, Dr Eric Lofgren is quoted as saying the following:

&gt; ""When people react to public health emergencies, how those reactions really shape the course of things. We often view epidemics as these things that sort of happen to people. There's a virus and it's doing things. But really it's a virus that's spreading between people, and how people interact and behave and comply with authority figures, or don't, those are all very important things. And also that these things are very chaotic. You can't really predict 'oh yeah, everyone will quarantine. It'll be fine.' No, they won't.”

comment,,2021-12-17 21:29:17,"#The Gates of Ahn’Qiraj

[This was]( https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowpedia/images/c/c7/World_of_Warcraft_13th_Anniversary_art_contest_-_Tim_Guo.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20180113233350), and remains the most well-known event from Vanilla WoW, and for good reason. The date was 3 January 2006, and Blizzard were releasing the much-anticipated patch 1.9.0. Food buffs would no longer stack, shard bags were introduced, and the Ahn’Qiraj world event would begin. It would affect every one of WoW’s six million (at the time) players. 

[Ahn’Qiraj](https://mmo4ever.com/cataclysm/gfx/maps/large/5695.jpg) is a huge complex of insect-strewn architecture in the south-western corner of Kalimdor, crowned by impenetrable mountains and only possible to enter through a monumental, hexagon-shaped [gate]( http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5862/910/1600/WoWScrnShot_021906_144736.0.jpg) in Silithus, [to the north](https://dungeon.guide/pictures/dungeon/map/ruinsofahnqirajlocation.jpg). Ahn Qiraj contained two raids, the [Ruins]( https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Ruins_of_Ahn%27Qiraj) and the [Temple](https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Temple_of_Ahn%27Qiraj). But rather than simply throw open the gates to all and sundry, Blizzard created an event designed to unite entire servers around the goal of getting in. What followed was a clusterfuck of such enormity that it made headlines even outside of the gaming sphere.

[There were three phases to the event.]( https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gates_of_Ahn%27Qiraj)

Firstly, players on both factions would work for weeks to collect resources – hundreds of millions of them. Food, bandages, metals, herbs. Everyone chipped in. The economies across every server collapsed as resources were siphoned away to open the gates. Prices shot through the ceiling.

This part of the process could last from several weeks to half a year. Since each faction had a separate shopping list, it was meant to become a race to see who could get there first. However most servers had/have a major faction population imbalance, and so one finished drastically quicker and ended up waiting in frustration. 

Then came a set of extremely long and challenging quests, which only the best guilds could even think of tackling. The reward was a legendary item – the Scepter of the Shifting Sands. To be the holder of the Scepter was a magnificent honour, with much political backstabbing and conspiracy to ensure it fell into the right hands. Only that person with the Sceptre could ring the Scarab Gong and open the gates (and once they did, they would gain a legendary mount to ride around on).

&gt; (Gong Ringer's Name), Champion of the Bronze Dragonflight, has rung the Scarab Gong. The ancient gates of Ahn'Qiraj open, revealing the horrors of a forgotten war…

With the gates open, the real battle would begin. Obelisks appeared throughout the world, floating ominously in the sky. For ten hours, [ultra powerful enemies]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4Ymm7676Q) flowed out out, swarming players and killing them off in droves. But the enemies dropped valuable loot, so thousands of players flooded Silithus to get a piece of the action. [Many thousands]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhYqtAMxqGA). Too many, in fact.

More than had ever assembled in one spot, and it was enough to break the game. Servers saw rolling crashes and such colossal lag that players began to flee the battle ground in the vain hope that it might make the game more stable. Boats glitched out and disappeared with the players still on them, reappearing in a ghostly nonexistent space beneath the world, dead players got transported to cemetaries on another continent - it was utter chaos.

The server to open the gates first was Medivh, on the 23rd January (still an effort lasting twenty days), but others took months. Aside from the greater drama of the event itself, there were many smaller stories taking place within the insanity. Major guilds coveted the wealth of Ahn’Qiraj for themselves, and went to great lengths to get it.

Rather than slowly contribute to the resource pool, they would privately hoard them until they had enough to open the gates on their own. In some guilds, spies would sell information on when the gates were going to be opened. Players would try to steal the sceptre from other guild-mates.

And it didn’t end here. It needed to be repeated every time Blizzard opened a new WoW server – which they were doing a lot, as the game was leaping from strength to strength. It was only in February 2009 that a patch was implemented so that all new servers would release with the gates already open. Ahn’Qiraj was finally over for good. The world event entered into history.

History became legend.

Legend became myth.

And over many years, the gates passed out of all memory. They were still there, quietly seething in a dark forgotten corner of the world. But to many new players, they were nothing more than window dressing in an old zone that no one wanted to level through anymore. 

But they were all of them deceived, for [another gate was made.]( https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23482836/wow-classic-ahnqiraj-the-scarab-lords-are-rising) But that story will have to wait until later down our timeline.

#The Funeral of Fayejin

This is one of the many strange and curious events that took place in WoW’s early days, back when guilds were more than a place to collect an XP boost. They were closely knit communities who stayed friends for years. These days, when a guild member logs off for the last time, it goes by without notice. But that was not always the case. 

Fayejin was a well-loved player on the Illidan PvP server (we’ll get to that), where she played a horde mage. On 28 February 2006, she died of a heart attack. Her guildmates decided to honour her with a digital funeral. Fayejin loved fishing and snow, so they went with one of Vanilla Wow’s most atmospheric zones, Winterspring. It was one of her favourite places in the game. 

The funeral was advertised online on all the popular forums of the time, with an open invitation to anyone who wanted to come along. There were dozens of respondents. When the time came, they were summoned to Winterspring. One of Fayejin’s friends was able to get onto her account, and logged on so that other players could say their final goodbyes. It was beautiful. 

There were even characters from the Alliance present, in a cross-faction gesture of respect. Rather a lot of them, in fact. And they were all carrying weapons. If that struck anyone as odd, they never had time to contemplate it.

Within minutes, everyone was murdering each other and teabagging the corpses. As is tradition. Black tuxedos don’t do much against knives, and you can’t change your armour when you’re in combat, so the mourners were left defenceless. It was a slaughter.

The raid was the work of the ironically named Serenity Now, and would follow them for years. The organisers insisted that they were honouring Fayejin with one final battle – she was an avid PvP fan, after all. Perhaps the bloody violence that ensued was more fitting than a load of people standing around making sombre emotes at one another. But nonetheless, the [forums reacted in anger]( http://warriornation.net/Forum/showthread.php?t=183648), though many found it hilarious. 

A video of the funeral survives to us from [the time]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP4OdfqypFk) thanks to a youtuber named ‘Women Shouldn’t Vote Productions’. [Here’s another video about it]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtYkGl8wZ4). [And another]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDcq2knko9Y). It made it to the gaming media, partly because of its climactic ending, partly because of the discourse over whether the raid was acceptable, and partly because [nobody had ever held an event quite like it before]( https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cj44bm/the_infamous_serenity_now_funeral_crash_march_4/). On the one hand, it was a funeral, and you can’t just attack a funeral. On the other hand, it was a PvP server and attacking was the whole point of the game. The ethical quandry [still divides players today]( https://www.gamesradar.com/the-wow-funeral-raid-four-years-later/).

Fayejin’s Funeral is referenced in a 2009 academic paper by Stacey Goguen, titled *Dual Wielding Morality: World of Warcraft and the Ethics of Ganking* and submitted to the ‘Philosophy of Computer Games Conference’ in Oslo. 

Regardless of ethics, the raid is what made the funeral famous, and gave Fayejin a place in WoW history. What more could you ask for?

comment,,2021-12-17 21:29:25,"#The Barrens Chat

[Every zone in WoW has its own regional chat]( https://massivelyop.com/2015/04/23/massively-overthinking-overcoming-barrens-chat-culture/). Opon crossing the border, you will enter that chat and be able to talk to other players in the area. In most cases, these chats are silent and ignored, with one glaring exception.

The Barrens was a large, relatively [empty]( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Do5s0MQvF9s/maxresdefault.jpg) zone where most new Horde players were funnelled after level 10, and where they would remain until level 20. It was a really boring zone, so players chatted to make it go quicker. Barrens chat became [infamous]( https://preview.redd.it/0egeh8iw89j31.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=df6665fabc5fc5f608ee35165e7bde605946a816) for its juvenile and incessant nature, its [bizarre]( https://pm1.narvii.com/6059/3b70269c484b558321567a2b0da1e48d8f132901_hq.jpg) conversations and memes, but players would sometimes find themselves talking about philosophy, physics, theoretical science, ethics, law, or whatever subject happened to come up. After out-levelling the Barrens, a lot of players would go back to hang out and make jokes about Chuck Norris.

One of the most popular Barrens memes was Mankrik’s Wife. You see, [one quest]( https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:Lost_in_Battle) tasked players with helping an NPC named Mankrik find his lost wife. But since the game didn’t indicate where she was, and there is no NPC called Mankrik’s Wife – she has the unfortunate name ‘Beaten Corpse’ - they often never found her. This all happened in a time before[ every single answer to every question could be found online]( https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/6/68/Wowhead_Mankrik%27s_Wife.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091101132842). So naturally, [newbies would consult the local chat.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8h6r40/whats_so_special_about_barrens_chat_my_boi_sit_a/)

Over time, the players loitering in the Barrens for the social scene began to find this question annoying. It got asked over and over and over again. And as you might expect, the answers gradually became less and less helpful. [New players found themselves pointed toward bizarre, far off destinations like Blackrock Mountain or Stormwind City.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo6-6D-L0l0) 

In 2010, the Cataclysm expansion released, and all of the Vanilla zones were revamped, [Barrens included]( https://www.escapistmagazine.com/chronicles-of-cataclysm-the-death-of-the-barrens-chat/). Mankirk’s wife was laid to rest, but her name would live on forever. 

Even today, Blizzard sells a shirt that says “I survived Barrens chat.”

comment,,2021-12-17 21:29:33,"#The Racism Problem

From the very beginning, [questions were asked]( https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/it%E2%80%99s-about-time-we-addressed-the-racism-and-other-issues-in-world-of-warcraft/161103) about WoW’s relationship with race. Often, fans laughed them off, or responded with aggression, but these conversations continued well into the present. 

Every race has a different backstory, a different home, and most importantly, a different set of abilities. Undead (who had once been humans) could originally speak to humans – the only race who could communicate across the faction boundary – but that was removed because it was being rapidly abused. Certain races could only be certain classes – the nature-oriented Tauren could be shamans and druids, but never warlocks or mages, whereas the more civilised humans could be hunters, but couldn’t be druids.

But what drew the most attention was the real-world people these races were based on. Cultural borrowing is nothing new to MMOs or the fantasy genre, with Tolkien directly comparing his Dwarves to Jews and his orcs to ‘Mongoloids’. Tauren, Humans, Dwarves, and Trolls were caricatures of real world cultures.

Dwarves, taking a leaf out of the Lord of the Rings movies, were Scottish Human architecture was generically European, though they spoke with American accents. [Many players pointed out that there was a distinct lack of non-white humans in the story]( https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/it%E2%80%99s-about-time-we-addressed-the-racism-and-other-issues-in-world-of-warcraft/161103), and while it was possible to create a dark-skinned human, none of the face options had non-white features. So even the blackest human looked like a white person with a tan.

&gt;There are no non-white human heroes or NPCs as far as I am aware, I certainly cannot think of a single one off the top of my head.

A lot of players asked Blizzard to add more variety to the character designs, but it would take an astonishing 16 years [for that to happen]( https://www.usgamer.net/articles/wow-shadowlands-black-and-asian-faces-human-characters#:~:text=Some%20players%20have%20long%20asked,like%20Blizzard%20has%20finally%20listened.&amp;text=Humans%20will%20be%20able%20to,Asian%20and%20Black%20facial%20options.)

The Tauren are clearly based on Native Americans – they’re giagantic, nomadic bull-people with braids and piercings, who boast a spiritual connection to the hand,[ live in teepees, and whose capital city is literally a colossal totem pole. ]( https://www.autosave.tv/2018/08/14/fantastic-racism-the-problem-with-world-of-warcraft/) For years, Native American people drew issue with this.

&gt;When you grow up as a Native American, you grow up seeing your culture used as a plaything by the mainstream. We are constantly reduced to a caricature and commodified. Blizzard has perpetuated this history in American media with their massively successful and long-running MMORPG.

&gt;Their developers gave the borrowed elements a fantasy paint job and stripped them of their real world cultural identifiers. In doing so they created a race that is instantly identifiable as Native American to its users, while retaining nothing directly belonging to an actual tribe. The Tauren are thus doubly offensive to me for being blatant cultural appropriation for the express purpose of commercial gain, while also continuing the erasure of actual real life natives in the popular consciousness. Hundreds of distinct cultures amalgamated into one group of bull people and their “braves”.

Trolls were… [well, just read their description for yourself.]( https://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2006/05/cultural_borrow.html) 

&gt;...Lean predators, they're as tall as night elves when they stand fully erect, but normally bob along, hunched over, coiled and ready to spring. While Warcraft players know them by their Jamaican accents, voodoo-flavored culture and wild hairstyles, the trolls are also cruel, sadistic and evil...

This description neglects to mention they were also cannibals. They hobble around with scabbed knuckles, pock-marked skin, tusks, skull adornments, and wild shaggy hair. They were heavily inspired by Haiti/Jamaica, with Zulu influences thrown in for good measure. This portrayal in particular ruffled a few feathers, because it’s not a positive one.[ A significant subset of fans found the game’s trolls offensive, and demanded change.]( https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/03/10/287686746/our-conversation-on-race-in-world-of-warcraft-unabridged)

But if Blizzard even noticed this outcry, they didn’t care. Later expansions would introduce more races based on stereotypes – far stronger ones, in fact. Worgen are a pastiche of Victorian cockneys, Goblins are Jewish-Italian New Yorker mob bosses with some unsettling antisemitic references (huge noses, disgusting skin, accents, obsession with wealth, absolute psychopathy, con aritsts and crooks). Draenei are vaguely Eastern European refugees from another world, and  Pandaren are literally just Chinese pandas with fake accents – but we’ll get to them later.

In the essay [“Multiculturalism in World of Warcraft”,]( https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/multiculturalism-in-world-of-warcraft/) Christopher Douglas examines the issue in enormous detail, and long story short, he agrees that the portrayals in the game are racist. 

&gt;In Azeroth, of course, race is not understood as socially constructed, but rather to be a biological fact. Composed of inherited, immutable, essential differences, race in Azeroth is the old-fashioned (which is to say, nineteenth and early twentieth-century) notion that the outward packaging signifies an inner reality, where the differences are.

WoW has an incredibly complex backstory, with vast amounts of worldbuilding, so it would be wrong to say these races are just thrown lazily together. But the fact remained that there were overtones of racism in many of them. [If anything, the story sometimes supports this]( https://gamerant.com/world-of-warcraft-exploring-azeroth-kalimdor-book-criticism/), such as the time Humans locked up Orcs in internment camps and used them as slaves, which apparently had the positive effect of reducing their desire to kill. Those based on non-European ethnic groups went in the Horde (the faction associated with chaos, primitivism, bloodthirst, barbarism, and savagery), those based on Europeans went in the Alliance. And a large part of the game involved taking allegiance based on your race and killing members of the ‘enemy’ races.

&gt;If you are a member of one race, you hate and are hated by this “other” race. We’re literally fighting race wars here, and it’s more than a little unsettling how much it’s just accepted.

Blizzard has tried to undermine the idea that the Alliance is good and the Horde are evil many times, over multiple years. But they would fail again and again, and seem to be inexplicably drawn to portraying them as absolutely vile. Many players like to imagine WoW as a utopian society where – despite the clear connections between certain races and real-life cultures – all players can be whoever they want without prejudice. But it doesn’t take a very close look to see that isn’t true at all.

It doesn’t help that the WoW community long had its own issue with real racism toward players.

&gt;We are all Mexican and had really strong accents. One of my friends couldn't quite speak much English at all. We got a lot of bad responses from guilds and got kicked out or resigned because of reactions to our accents and stuff like that. Eventually we found one that was really awesome about it and we would even feel comfortable talking to each other in Spanish during raids in order to not distract anyone else."" Said[ Hernandez in an interview with NPR. ]( https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/03/08/287368917/what-world-of-warcraft-can-teach-us-about-race-irl?t=1639523099029)

These problems seem to have improved over the years, as WoW’s userbase has grown older and become more open, [but in many ways they have not]( https://kotaku.com/report-chat-logs-reveal-pervasive-racism-in-top-world-1846356208). And this is just race. WoW has always had a similarly strange relationship with sexuality and gender. Speaking of which…

comment,,2021-12-17 21:29:44,"#The Homophobia Problem

Gamers have long had a querulous history with homophobia. You couldn’t get through a single conversation in Vanilla without someone calling you a fag, and it still pops up a lot now. Blizzard themselves have denounced prejudice toward the LGBT community many times, but this may be a case of [‘do as I say, not as I do’. ]( https://www.gameskinny.com/as926/blizzard-entertainment-says-lovewins-after-years-of-homophobia-and-transmisogyny). 

When a woman named Sara Andrews set up a guild marketed toward being LGBT inclusive, she was [threatened with a ban from administrators,]( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4700754.stm) due to the language she was using. They claimed ‘advertising sexual orientation is not appropriate for the high fantasy setting of World of Warcraft’. That’s pretty rich considering the kind of things WoW players say every day – in a much worse tone. The controversy was so great that – once again – WoW ended up in the headlines. 

&gt;To publicise her plight, Ms Andrews visited many discussion sites and forums where Warcraft players gather. The debate that followed largely criticised Blizzard for its heavy-handed treatment.

&gt;Many pointed out that Warcraft has a thriving community of gay players, or gaymers, and that it made no sense to censor talk about players' sexuality outside Azeroth.

&gt;Gay pride marches are known to have taken place in Warcraft and there are many other guilds in the game that are known to be friendly toward the gay community.

&gt;Two such guilds, Stonewall Champions and The Spreading Taint wrote an open letter to Blizzard criticising its policy.

At first, Blizzard tried to defend their stance. “Topics related to sensitive real-world subjects -- such as religious, sexual or political preference, for example -- have had a tendency to result in communication between players that often breaks down into harassment”, they said. Quite simply, their police on sexuality was ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’, and that only amplified the rage aimed their way. Discussions began to stir of possible legal challenges. They eventually backtracked and publicly apologised to Andrews, promising that its GMs would be given more thorough training on how to handle LGBT issues, but this would be far from the last incident.

[Blizzard landed in hot]( https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzcons-peculiar-homophobic-moment) water again in 2011 [as one lesbian gamer pointed out during a Q&amp;A session at Blizzon]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW_Lv0r-l4c) there had not been a single LGBT character in any Blizzard game or property – ever. Creative Director Chris Metzen responded that LGBT characters were ‘certainly a possibility’.  The woman who asked about diversity was then harassed on the WoW forums afterward.

Metzen’s open-ended statement would soon turn sour. Blizzard had collaborated for years with the band Cannibal Corpse, who was [recorded during an interview]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW_Lv0r-l4c) at that same convention saying, “Go fucking cry in a river and tell me about how you’re going to slit your wrists you Night Elf f*****.”

Blizzard’s art director, Sam Didier, endorsed the video and invited the band to play on stage. It took a week of negative press for Blizzard president Mike Morkaime to apologise. 

A year later, Blizzard turned the profanity filter on by default, and players suddenly noticed that the words ‘transsexual’ and ‘homosexual’ were filtered out, but not ‘fag’ or ‘faggot. Blizzard was quick to change the filter, but the damage was done. [The community wanted to know why those words had been blocked in the first place]( https://www.engadget.com/2012-01-25-profanity-filters-homophobic-slurs-and-blizzards-shaky-relati.html) – someone at Blizzard had to have made the decision. Unfortunately, that thread seems to be lost now, but I can tell you it was an absolute clusterfuck that spun rapidly out of control. [Members of the Gaymer.com]( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2006/jan/30/howqueerwowa) forums had tried on previous occasions to force Blizzard to address the use of homophobic slurs in the game, with no success.

&gt;I emailed Blizzard and asked them to do something, Blizzard's response was ""just ignore em, they'll go away"", riiiiiiiiight, like that's ever worked with a gay basher. So my retort was why would other slurs against minorities go punished, yet calling someone a faggot in open forum is to be ""ignored""...

When asked again about diversity at a 2015 [MIT Media Lab event]( http://www.media.mit.edu/video/view/conversations-2014-05-07), then-chief creative officer Rob Pardo dismissed the idea, stating:

&gt;I wouldn’t say that’s really a value for us. It’s not something that we’re against either, but it’s just not … something we’re trying to actively do. 

For this gaff, they[ received an open letter]( http://starcunning.tumblr.com/post/90774227279/an-open-letter-to-mike-morhaime) which spoke on behalf of LGBT players, stating they no longer felt valued by the company. 

&gt; The comments made by Mr. Pardo and Mr. Browder, speaking as employees of Blizzard Entertainment, seem to imply that representing people like me will never be a priority to the company. They seem to be suggesting I go elsewhere. 

[Morhaime once again apologised (be prepared for that to happen a lot going forward)]( https://starcunning.tumblr.com/post/91222937564/re-an-open-letter-to-mike-morhaime). “This will be an ongoing process for us—it’s likely that we will make mistakes again in the future, but we will continue to listen, learn, and grow.”

Sadly it would take a few more years for Blizzard to learn how to not hate the gays. 

[Just recently in 2019, there would be another controversy over LGBT guilds]( https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/10/world-warcraft-removes-gay-guilds-name-anti-gay-players-think-inappropriate/). A pro-homosexuality guild called ‘GAY BOYS’ was reported  “an inappropriate number of times” by other players until Blizzard forcibly removed the name. The guild had been warned before by a forum moderator in 2016, who said, “Picking a name that you can identify with without also using words that would illicit [sic] a reaction from other players would be far more beneficial.” Indeed, members of GAY BOYS claimed they had received abusive messages for their guild name over the years, such as [“Fuck the gays, reported.”]( https://www.out.com/tech/2019/10/11/world-wonder-wont-allow-gay-boys-guild-lgbtq-players)

The Guild Master blamed rampant homophobia within the WoW community, and accused Blizzard of kowtowing to this subset of players. An in-game pride march was held in protest of the decision, and they were able to successfully appeal it.

&gt; “To say there is anything inappropriate about the words GAY or BOYS is, in and of itself, inappropriate, childish, and discriminatory,” Jilani said.

Blizzard had often taken the stance that ‘if you ignore it, it will go away’, but in 2020, [they finally declared that homophobia had never existed in Azeroth](https://twitter.com/tricycle_clown/status/1281260746182201346?s=21), with the intention of undermining roleplayers who [tried to RP as bigots]( https://www.wowhead.com/news/shadowlands-lore-interview-with-lead-narrative-designer-steve-danuser-elune-316807). It wasn’t much, but it was something.

It’s hard to say whether Blizzard has improved over the years, but based on recent allegations (we’ll get there), I have my doubts.

comment,,2021-12-17 21:29:53,"#The Devilsaur Mafia

No sooner had WoW developed an economy than pernicious capitalists began to exploit it. Sites opened up, offering gold, rare items, and accounts with powerful characters in exchange for real money. Where these sites acquired it, no one knew for sure, though there were rumours. Most assumed they just bought it from players at a low price and then sold it at a mark-up, and that definitely happened. But the owners of these sites sought to maximise profits, and minimise costs. The solution was to set up sweat shops in China. Dozens, if not hundreds of them. 

Multiple interviews have been done with Chinese gold farmers. They all described it as mentally exhausting, with working days of at least 12 hours, often spent killing a single enemy over and over. The value of farmed gold is different across the world. A day’s worth of gold could sell in China for $4 dollars, but could fetch triple that amount when sold to Americans. 

&gt;[It's by exploiting the differences and selling to cash-rich, time-poor gamers that Chinese gold farms prosper.]( https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10165824&amp;t=1639522614539) Former Wall Street banker Alan Chiu founded an online trading platform for virtual currency, a virtual stock exchange, if you will. And he sees videogame work as another opportunity for outsourcing.

&gt;“It's a very labor-intensive job. I don't see it any different from low-cost Chinese workers working in Guandong, producing Nike shoes, and for Nike to be sold eventually - sold at retail stores for maybe 600 percent margin.”

&gt;Yet it is different because gold farming is a gray area. Gaming companies like Blizzard, which owns World of Warcraft, see gold farming as cheating, and regularly ban the accounts of suspected gold farmers. Robin admits he's been closed down four or five times, losing thousands of dollars each time. However, there's always a market for gold farmers. Surveys show 20 percent of gamers admit to buying gold.

According to the [New York Times]( https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/09/technology/ogre-to-slay-outsource-it-to-chinese.html), while some gold farmers enjoyed playing games all day, they nonetheless had strict quotas and were constantly supervised. They estimated that there were between 100,000 and 500,000 young people working in China as full-time gamers, earning less than a quarter an hour. It’s true that this practice did not originate with WoW. But WoW is perhaps the first time it became a major issue due to the sheer size of the playerbase, and the overwhelming demand for black market gold. 

For its part, Blizzard has tried to crack down on black markets, but arguably their most successful attempt was by creating the WoW token, effectively creating a legal avenue to sell gold via Blizzard. That has its own controversy, which we’ll get to later. 

[Gold farming was known to evoke a strong reaction]( https://www.ski-epic.com/world_of_warcraft_guide/world_of_warcraft_gold_farming_controversy.html). It was seen as violating the spirit of the game, and players looked down on those who used these sites. There was a sense that if you had suffered to reach where you are, then everyone else should have to as well. [Others defended it as yet another part of the free market, which catered to players who wanted to sacrifice money to ‘get ahead’.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3cmCKjPLR8)

In an interview with Jared Psigoda, [a market leader in virtual trade,]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWvHcoqru7I) he states that originally, these black markets were regionally exclusive. Europeans worked in the European black market, Chinese players in the Chinese, and Americans in the American, which resulted in dramatically different prices. It was in the early 2000s that the use of Chinese labour was used across the board, undercutting western currency exchanges, in order to make further profit. 

Perhaps the [most infamous]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDbscQWKi-U) group of gold farmers were the[ Devilsaur Mafia]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJZJJSOsjeQ). They realised killing devilsaurs in [Un’Goro Crater]( https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/ppungorocratermap.jpg) had the potential to return the highest profits out of any creature in the game. While devilsaurs didn’t drop much, they could be skinned to get Devilsaur Leather, a material from which a number of powerful pieces of hunter armour could be made, such as the Devilsaur Leggings and Devilsaur Gauntlets. Outside of raiding content, this was the best gear you could get in Vanilla wow. All in all, a single devilsaur could net its killer 20 gold – a kingly sum at the time.

[But where most enemies constantly reappeared, devilsaurs did not. They regenerated sparingly, and could appear anywhere in the zone.]( https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6498/devilsaur) Players would spend their whole day in the zone, waiting for one to spawn. And so, a group of sellers decided to coordinate their efforts.[ They completely took over the crater](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightshope/comments/984zax/how_the_devilsaur_mafia_works_from_a_mafia_member/), using their organisation to out-compete other farmers, and this indirectly gave them total control over the Devilsaur economy.

On PvP servers, these cartels had teams on both factions working as security – if a Horde player tried to step on the Mafia’s turf, the Alliance security team would be alerted and sent to hunt them down, kill them, and keep killing them every time they resurrected at a graveyard. [Technically speaking, cross-faction communication was against the Terms of Service, but it was almost impossible for Blizzard to prove players were communicating using third party apps]( https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cuttah/the_devilsaur_what_an_faq_on_the_devilsaur_mafia/). The only way to get close to a devilsaur on any PvP server was to submit to the whims of the mafia, which meant selling at regulated prices and handing over a cut of the spoils. All-out turf wars were known to occur when multiple cartels came up against each other.

This was not remotely the only instance of farmers banding together to control resources and manipulate the economy – that happened every single day. But it may be the most well-known. And when Classic Wow came about, players eagerly worked to recreate the Devilsaur Mafia. 

It’s an interesting case study, but the Mafia disappeared as WoW’s economy grew and changed. The gold farmers did not. For years, WoW’s economy would be driven by a black market that depended on sweat shop labour from China (and later other countries like Mexico, the Philippines and India). It never stopped, but the practice of online black markets for virtual currencies expanded far beyond WoW, to encompass many of the biggest games in the world. Blizzard still hasn’t been able to get rid of it. No company has.
