During 2012 playoffs a frustrated Amare Stoudemire, for unknown reasons, attacked a fire extinguisher minutes after the New York Knicks' Game 2 loss to the Miami Heat. The Knicks power forward suffered lacerations on his left hand which required stitches. He suffered the laceration on the inside of his palm, on the side of his hand closest to the pinkie. Subsequently, Amare has been extinguished from Game 3. It is important to note, that fire extinguisher's side of the story was never heard.

------------------------------

**BEEP, BEEP**

Shortly after inking a six-year, $66 million dollar contract extension, Monta Ellis torpedoed Golden State's 2008-09 season when he tore a ligament in his left ankle and sustained a high-ankle sprain in a ""low-speed"" moped accident. So not only did he screw his team over, he lost serious Man Points for getting injured not only on a moped...but while driving said moped at low speeds. 

---------------------------------------

**UPSETING THE GODS**

Tony Allen blew out his knee -- tearing both ACL and MCL -- while trying to throw one down after the whistle had blown. That's a direct message from the Basketball Gods, and it can be interpreted as: ""Thou shall not showboat, mortal fool!"" Oh, and he also missed the dunk.

----------------------------------------

**BIG BALLS TOO MUCH FOR THE WOLVES' TITLE HOPES**

The Minnesota Timberwolves' best chance of reaching the Finals with Kevin Garnett came in 2004, but Sam Cassell injured his hip before the start of the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers defeated the Wolves and played the Detroit Pistons in the Finals. ""All the time,"" said Flip Saunders about Cassell's injury. ""It was his hip. He made a shot out of the corner against Sacramento in Game 7 [of the conference semifinals], and he did his little Big Balls dance, and from that, he created a little avulsion fracture in his hip. No question, I think about that dance all the time. But that’s the NBA. I went to four straight conference finals in Minnesota and Detroit, and we had injury issues in each one. The team that wins the title is usually the healthiest team.""

-------------------------

**PRO BOWL**

Andrew Bynum injured his knee when going bowling, while being injured. Yes he did.

---------------------------

**NIGHT PARALYSIS**

In 2012 Kevin Love slept with his right arm extended off his bed all night and when he woke up he couldn't move it and had to miss the next game. 

------------------------

**STEVE THE SPIKE**

Lakers guard (at the time) Steve Blake suffered a puncture wound to his left foot after stepping on a spike strip in a parking lot. He was out for three weeks. Blake said he hurt himself when he ""got distracted going back to my truck"". Good job, Steve.

--------------------------

**LOTION-EYEZ KILLA**

Charles Barkley missed the Phoenix Suns' 1994-95 season opener because the first layers of his corneas got burned off by body lotion during an Eric Clapton concert. Apparently, allergies and the dazzling stage lights caused Sir Charles to rub his eyes, and he got lotion in them. Phoenix Suns team doctor, Richard Emerson, said: ""It was a chemical reaction to a type of lotion that he uses. I wouldn't anticipate it'll reoccur because I don't think he'll use that type again."" 

---------------------------------


**SLEEPIN' &amp; CHILLIN'**

Prior to the 1995-96 NBA season, BJ Tyler was selected by the Toronto Raptors in the 1995 expansion draft. According to journalist Chris Young's book Drive, Tyler accidentally fell asleep with a pack of ice on his knee, severely damaging it and thus losing all the speed for which he was famed, and subsequently had to retire.

--------------------------

**DISHES GET STICHES**
Brad Miller needed nine stitches in his right index finger after almost chopping it off with a knife while doing dishes last season...on the same day he was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career. Said Miller: ""It's the last time I help do dishes."" Said teammate Mikki Moore: ""When I saw him, it was all wrapped up. So, I said, 'You're going to drop 20 and 20 in two games and then go and cut your knuckle off?' I said, 'That's real smart, Brad.' He said, 'Nah, that's my luck.'"" 

--------------------------------------------

**""THANKS REF""**

During the 2001-02 season, Corey Maggette got so upset over a call that he slammed his hand on the scorer's table in frustration and dislocated the ring and little fingers on his right hand. Maggette ended up with a cast and a four-week vacation.


-------------------------------------

**FINALS MVP**

Ah, Darko, Darko, Darko. He was put in for what was described as a ""token"" appearance in the Pistons' Game 5 blowout of the Lakers in the 2004 NBA Finals. He played 2 minutes, finishing with 1 rebound, 1 steal, 1 turnover...and 1 broken hand. Oh yes he did. The injury required surgury and sidelines him for eight weeks. 

--------------------------

**CAN'T HANDLE THE JOE**

Derrick Coleman -- whose NBA career was limited and cut short largely due to injury problems -- got injured again, only this time it happened while filming an episode of the TV show Pros vs. Joes. DC was participating in a rebounding challenge against some ""average joe"" when he came down from a jump and landed awkwardly, hurting his always-troublesome knee. This means that Coleman probably has the dubious distinction of being the first Pro to ever get injured during battle with a Joe.

-------------------------------------------

**SLICING AND DICING**

The Bulls rookie (at the time) Derrick Rose was forced to miss some practice time because, get ready for it, he cut himself under the elbow on his left forearm. In bed. From a knife he used to slice an apple. Said Rose: ""Silly accident this morning. I went to get a bottle of water, forgot the knife was there and sat down and sliced my arm. I panicked when it first happened. I called [Bulls trainer Fred Tedeschi]. We got it stitched up about 8 [a.m.]. It was a large wound, but they healed it up. I'm good. I could have practiced, but they told me to wait until [today]. I can still dribble, shoot, do all that stuff. I'm hoping they'll let me play.""

------------------------------------

**HOW TO PUT ON A SHOE 101**

In December 2001, before a game against the Washington Wizards, DirK Nowitzki sprained a tendon in his ankle when he put his shoe on improperly and the stomped his foot on the floor to make sure it was on right. The injury was so bad he missed the game. 

---------------------------------------

**HIDDEN DANGERS OF A WALK-THROUGH**

Eddy Curry had to miss a game due to a badly sprained left ankle suffered at...a walk-through at his team's morning shoot-around. Nope. I'm not kidding. Said teammate Malik Rose: ""How do you explain something like that?"" Good question. A very good question.

----------------------------

**E-CITY VS PHYSIOBALL**
Speaking of good questions, here's another: Can a player suffer a more embarrassing injury than spraining his ankle during a walk-through? Well, the answer is ""yes"" my friends. From the New York Daily News: ""Poor Eddy Curry. He sat on the giant blue physioball during a break from Monday's practice and the ball exploded. Eddy fell and scraped and his wrist but should be okay. The ball, which is used for stretching exercises, was pronounced dead at the scene."" This also answers the classic ""How do you know when you're too fat?"" question.

-----------------------------------

**""I TRIED TO WARN HIM"" - Eddy Curry**

Francisco Garcia broke his arm...on a physioball. No, really. At least he wasn't so fat it exploded on him...

-----------------------------

**DIAL 555-INJURY**

Prior to Game 3 of the 1992 first round playoff series between the Indiana Pacers and the Boston Celtics, George McCloud ""held his ankle in a funny way"" while talking on the phone. This somehow injured the ankle so badly he couldn't play in the game and had to sit on the bench in street clothes as his team got eliminated. 

----------------------------

**AGENT ZERO'S BARBERSHOP**

File this one under ""unfortunate pube shaving accidents."" Very unfortunate. I'll let Gilbert Arenas tell the tale: ""When I was new in the NBA the team veterans convinced me to shave, you know, down there, because they said the hair stinks. I used my girlfriend's razor, which was rusty and gave me keloids. The doctor prescribed medicine to dab on, but I just poured it all over. Three days later I woke up screaming. The skin was burnt off my scrotum, down to my crack, everything -- just raw flesh. I still had to run and play, so I used a numbing spray for a month until it healed. Now I use clippers.""

-----------------------------

**OFF TO A GREAT START**

Greg Ostertag fractured the third metacarpal on his right hand in October of 2004 when he tripped on a footstool while getting out of bed. Mind you, this happened after his first day of practice with his new team, the Sacramento Kings.

--------------------------

**THE LUGGAGE CONSPIRACY**

1991 Jeff Ruland made a comeback for the Sixers. He was out of action for five years but attempted to return for the 1991-92 season. However, the comeback ended because of...a luggage cart. Yes, a luggage cart, which was (allegedly) rammed into Ruland's leg by a Celtics employee as he waited for a team bus outside Boston Garden. (It should be noted that Ruland was not a popular in Boston, and he was even nicknamed ""McNasty"" by the Celtics' late great broadcaster Johnny Most.) Ruland said: ""I got run over by a luggage cart. That's hard to swallow. It can't be accidental, they were moving too fast. Whoever could foresee anything like this happening?""

------------------------------------

**PERK'S TIC-TAC-TOE**

Boston's big man (at the time) Kendrick Perkins missed time due to a right big toe that was injured when he dropped a bed on it. ""I was asleep. I guess whoever put my bed together didn't put it together right when I moved, so one side of my bed fell. My bed was tilted, so I got out of my bed to go push down on the other side. And when I was about getting ready to push down on the other side, the headboard started coming in. So I tried to push the headboard back so it wouldn't fall over. My foot was under the bed and the other side of the bed fell on my foot."" Man, I hate it when that happens.

-------------------------------

**CRIPPLING BUZZER-BEATER**

During the mid-90s, Kevin Johnson won a regular season game on a buzzer-beating shot and received a crippling bear hug from teammate Charles Barkley. And I mean ""crippling"" in the literal sense. Chuck squeezed Kevin so hard his shoulder was dislocated. (At least Barkley didn't rub any body lotion in KJ's eyes.) He was out of action for the next two weeks. KJ also had hernia surgery in 1996 after years of abdominal problems that were allegedly brought on by picking up teammate Oliver Miller to celebrate a play.

----------------------------

**TALL PEOPLE PROBLEMS**

Kobe Bryant hurt his back. Vacuuming. But he says it's because of vacuum size discrimination. 

------------------------------

**AIR TAKES OUT BIRD**

In the fall of 1988, Larry Bird was attempting a comeback from dual achilles surgery when he permanently injured in his back. How? He was undercut by Michael Jordan, who then fell on Bird...in the Kenny Rogers Charity Basketball Tournament in Kentucky. According to his second autobiography, Bird Watching: On Playing and Coaching The Game I Love, Bird said: ""We were in the final minutes of this charity basketball game when I went up for a rebound and came down a little sideways. Michael Jordan was going for the ball too, and he landed on my back. Right away I knew I was in trouble. I had torn additional portions of the disc wall, and my back was really traumatized. I didn't know it then, all the way back in 1989, but that was the beginning of the end…I never came all the way back."" 

------------------------

**""I GOT A YACHT TO FEED""**

Latrell Sprewell, the man whose hands once said 'hello' to his coach's neck, broke his hand by taking a swing at the boyfriend of a female party guest who threw up on his yacht. But it seems that Spree's punches were roughly as accurate as his jumpers (42 percent lifetime): He whiffed and punched the wall instead. Sprewell tried to cover up the incident, but some of his guests leaked the story and the Knicks fined Spree $250,000 for not reporting the injury. Sprewell complained about it to the press. ""They talk about being a family but they're not sticking with me. The biggest thing to me is that I'm hurt. So don't kick me when I'm down."" 

--------------------------

**DNP - GAMING**

Lionel Simmons suffered an injury during the 1990-91 season: He missed two games with wrist tendonitis caused by overtraining on his Nintendo Game Boy.

Note that, a year later, Derrick McKey missed seven games with the same injury.

-------------------------- 

**AQUA LUC**

During the 1996-97 season, the Bulls lost Luc Longley's services for seven weeks after he got hurt body surfing. Yeah. Luc was body-surfing off the coast of Los Angeles coast when an unexpectedly strong wave drove him shoulder-first into the ocean floor and knocked his clavicle and shoulder out of place.

--------------------

**HIS SMOKENESS**

Although Michael Jordan  was already kinda sorta unofficially retired (again), Jordan severed a tendon in his right index finger (i.e., on his shooting hand) while using a cigar cutter in January 1999. Officially listed as a ""a laceration of the flexor tendon,"" Jordan needed surgery to repair it and six weeks of occupational therapy to rehabilitate it.

--------------------------

**HIGH MUGGSY**

Muggsy Bogues, the tiny, tiny man (who was playing for the Toronto Raptors at the time) missed the second half of a game against the Portland Trailblazers after accidentally sucking in some ointment fumes during a halftime treatment. Said Bogues: ""Never happened to me before and I hope it never happens again. That was one of those fluke things you don't even dream about.""

---------------------------

**TEAM BONDING**

This entry harkens back to 2003, during Portland's infamous ""Jail Blazer"" era. Ruben Patterson ended up with a shiny black eye thanks to a five-knuckeled ""hello"" from teammate Zach Randolph. Patterson, who earlier that season had been arrested on suspicion of domestic assault, was arguing with Qyntel Woods, who himself had been recently cited by Portland police on marijuana possession charges after a traffic stop, when Randolph stepped in and sucker-punched Patterson. While, it should be noted, Patterson was being restrained by teammates. Nice, huh? Patterson then promised not to retaliate...until his probation expired in May (it was April at the time). Good times all around. 

-------------------------

**EXTREME HOBBIES**

While playing for the Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan-less 1993-94 season, Scott Williams had a string of bizarre injuries. First, he missed four days of practice after straining his shoulder at the team's annual bowling outing. A few days later, he hurt his back lifting a TV he bought on sale. Then, later in the season, he injured a tendon behind his right kneecap while stretching, and that was the end of his season.

--------------------------

**RADMAN'S WINTER X-GAMES**

In February of 2007, Vladimir Radmanovic separated his shoulder falling on a patch of ice in Park City, Utah. Or so he claimed. But a few days later, Radmanovic admitted that he had actually hurt himself in a fall during a jump while snowboarding. Said the Radman: ""The truth is that I hurt myself in a fall while snowboarding. Being young and sometimes immature, I initially panicked and made up a false story about how I hurt myself. However, over the past few days my conscience has been bothering me terribly. I am not a dishonest person and could no longer live with this deception. Therefore, I came forward today and told the truth to the Lakers."" Mind you, his contract specifically banned him from taking part in activities that involve significant risk of injury, including skiing and snowboarding. The space cadet was fined $500,000.


------------------------------------

**LIGHTS OUT**

Carlos Boozer broke his hand after tripping over his gym because it was too dark to see at 6PM. Somebody was knocking at the door, and Boozer rushed to answer. On the way, he tripped over his big gym bag in the hall and fell. He went down awkwardly on his right hand and felt it pop. The neighbours later testified they heard an extremely loud ""AHHH AND-ONE!"" echoing through the neighbourhood.","**""ARE YOU EXTINGUISHING TO ME??""**

During 2012 playoffs a frustrated Amare Stoudemire, for unknown reasons, attacked a fire extinguisher minutes after the New York Knicks' Game 2 loss to the Miami Heat. The Knicks power forward suffered lacerations on his left hand which required stitches. He suffered the laceration on the inside of his palm, on the side of his hand closest to the pinkie. Subsequently, Amare has been extinguished from Game 3. It is important to note, that fire extinguisher's side of the story was never heard.

The skin was burnt off my scrotum, down to my crack, everything -- just raw flesh. I still had to run and play, so I used a numbing spray for a month until it healed. Now I use clippers.""

-----------------------------

**OFF TO A GREAT START**

Greg Ostertag fractured the third metacarpal on his right hand in October of 2004 when he tripped on a footstool while getting out of bed. Mind you, this happened after his first day of practice with his new team, the Sacramento Kings.

--------------------------

**THE LUGGAGE CONSPIRACY**

1991 Jeff Ruland made a comeback for the Sixers. He was out of action for five years but attempted to return for the 1991-92 season. However, the comeback ended because of...a luggage cart. Yes, a luggage cart, which was (allegedly) rammed into Ruland's leg by a Celtics employee as he waited for a team bus outside Boston Garden. (It should be noted that Ruland was not a popular in Boston, and he was even nicknamed ""McNasty"" by the Celtics' late great broadcaster Johnny Most.) Ruland said: ""I got run over by a luggage cart. That's hard to swallow. It can't be accidental, they were moving too fast. Whoever could foresee anything like this happening?""

------------------------------------

**PERK'S TIC-TAC-TOE**

Boston's big man (at the time) Kendrick Perkins missed time due to a right big toe that was injured when he dropped a bed on it. ""I was asleep. I guess whoever put my bed together didn't put it together right when I moved, so one side of my bed fell. My bed was tilted, so I got out of my bed to go push down on the other side. And when I was about getting ready to push down on the other side, the headboard started coming in. So I tried to push the headboard back so it wouldn't fall over. My foot was under the bed and the other side of the bed fell on my foot."" Man, I hate it when that happens.

-------------------------------

**CRIPPLING BUZZER-BEATER**

During the mid-90s, Kevin Johnson won a regular season game on a buzzer-beating shot and received a crippling bear hug from teammate Charles Barkley. And I mean ""crippling"" in the literal sense. Chuck squeezed Kevin so hard his shoulder was dislocated. (At least Barkley didn't rub any body lotion in KJ's eyes.) He was out of action for the next two weeks. KJ also had hernia surgery in 1996 after years of abdominal problems that were allegedly brought on by picking up teammate Oliver Miller to celebrate a play.

----------------------------

**TALL PEOPLE PROBLEMS**

Kobe Bryant hurt his back. Vacuuming. But he says it's because of vacuum size discrimination. 

------------------------------

**AIR TAKES OUT BIRD**

In the fall of 1988, Larry Bird was attempting a comeback from dual achilles surgery when he permanently injured in his back. How? He was undercut by Michael Jordan, who then fell on Bird...in the Kenny Rogers Charity Basketball Tournament in Kentucky. According to his second autobiography, Bird Watching: On Playing and Coaching The Game I Love, Bird said: ""We were in the final minutes of this charity basketball game when I went up for a rebound and came down a little sideways. Michael Jordan was going for the ball too, and he landed on my back. Right away I knew I was in trouble. I had torn additional portions of the disc wall, and my back was really traumatized. I didn't know it then, all the way back in 1989, but that was the beginning of the end…I never came all the way back."" 

------------------------

**""I GOT A YACHT TO FEED""**

Latrell Sprewell, the man whose hands once said 'hello' to his coach's neck, broke his hand by taking a swing at the boyfriend of a female party guest who threw up on his yacht. But it seems that Spree's punches were roughly as accurate as his jumpers (42 percent lifetime): He whiffed and punched the wall instead. Sprewell tried to cover up the incident, but some of his guests leaked the story and the Knicks fined Spree $250,000 for not reporting the injury. Sprewell complained about it to the press. ""They talk about being a family but they're not sticking with me. The biggest thing to me is that I'm hurt. So don't kick me when I'm down."" 

--------------------------

**DNP - GAMING**

Lionel Simmons suffered an injury during the 1990-91 season: He missed two games with wrist tendonitis caused by overtraining on his Nintendo Game Boy.

Note that, a year later, Derrick McKey missed seven games with the same injury.

-------------------------- 

**AQUA LUC**

During the 1996-97 season, the Bulls lost Luc Longley's services for seven weeks after he got hurt body surfing. Yeah. Luc was body-surfing off the coast of Los Angeles coast when an unexpectedly strong wave drove him shoulder-first into the ocean floor and knocked his clavicle and shoulder out of place.

--------------------

**HIS SMOKENESS**

Although Michael Jordan  was already kinda sorta unofficially retired (again), Jordan severed a tendon in his right index finger (i.e., on his shooting hand) while using a cigar cutter in January 1999. Officially listed as a ""a laceration of the flexor tendon,"" Jordan needed surgery to repair it and six weeks of occupational therapy to rehabilitate it.

--------------------------

**HIGH MUGGSY**

Muggsy Bogues, the tiny, tiny man (who was playing for the Toronto Raptors at the time) missed the second half of a game against the Portland Trailblazers after accidentally sucking in some ointment fumes during a halftime treatment. Said Bogues: ""Never happened to me before and I hope it never happens again. That was one of those fluke things you don't even dream about.""

---------------------------

**TEAM BONDING**

This entry harkens back to 2003, during Portland's infamous ""Jail Blazer"" era. Ruben Patterson ended up with a shiny black eye thanks to a five-knuckeled ""hello"" from teammate Zach Randolph. Patterson, who earlier that season had been arrested on suspicion of domestic assault, was arguing with Qyntel Woods, who himself had been recently cited by Portland police on marijuana possession charges after a traffic stop, when Randolph stepped in and sucker-punched Patterson. While, it should be noted, Patterson was being restrained by teammates. Nice, huh? Patterson then promised not to retaliate...until his probation expired in May (it was April at the time). Good times all around. 

-------------------------

**EXTREME HOBBIES**

While playing for the Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan-less 1993-94 season, Scott Williams had a string of bizarre injuries. First, he missed four days of practice after straining his shoulder at the team's annual bowling outing. A few days later, he hurt his back lifting a TV he bought on sale. Then, later in the season, he injured a tendon behind his right kneecap while stretching, and that was the end of his season.

--------------------------

**RADMAN'S WINTER X-GAMES**

In February of 2007, Vladimir Radmanovic separated his shoulder falling on a patch of ice in Park City, Utah. Or so he claimed. But a few days later, Radmanovic admitted that he had actually hurt himself in a fall during a jump while snowboarding. Said the Radman: ""The truth is that I hurt myself in a fall while snowboarding. Being young and sometimes immature, I initially panicked and made up a false story about how I hurt myself. However, over the past few days my conscience has been bothering me terribly. I am not a dishonest person and could no longer live with this deception. Therefore, I came forward today and told the truth to the Lakers."" Mind you, his contract specifically banned him from taking part in activities that involve significant risk of injury, including skiing and snowboarding. The space cadet was fined $500,000.


------------------------------------

**LIGHTS OUT**

Carlos Boozer broke his hand after tripping over his gym because it was too dark to see at 6PM. Somebody was knocking at the door, and Boozer rushed to answer. On the way, he tripped over his big gym bag in the hall and fell. He went down awkwardly on his right hand and felt it pop.

2022-09-02 17:42:29,Hanover low traffic area,"Hanover low traffic area Has anyone else had the nonsense, misleading, appeal to ignorance flyer through their door suggesting that the low traffic neighbourhood is bad for the environment? 

I'm really enraged to be honest. The first attempt at one in the city, with actually really limited changes to the traffic flow, on roads that I cycle on and get forced to stop because ""Mr look how big my balls are"" in his car or van has to prove a point. (Even though council tax pays for roads). 

It's so sad that this presumably funded pro-car-flyer has been distributed to encourage people to ""stop the forced LTN"" that will supposedly ""destroy Hanover"" has been circulated and I worry that it will lead to lots of car owners leaving feedback and lots of non car users, pedestrians, cyclists... Parents... Not actually leaving positive feedback. 

A low traffic neighbourhood will be better for people with sensory disabilities, those that cycle and can commute to work or to the station via bike without the worry of for example half asleep drivers blasting their horn at you as they speed down a side street, for those with kids who want to stretch their legs without the constant flow of traffic. The entire point is that cars can still get to their location via a road that is built to sustain the volume of traffic. For example where is there traffic lights and crossings in Hanover? I have also done some simple searches and the idea that the traffic will continue to be higher of the routes around Hanover is debunked, people in low traffic neighbourhoods tend to embrace the change and abandon their car (to some extent)

Ultimately are you in favour of trying and maybe failing, or are you in favour of not trying and sticking with business as usual, all the while having unsafe streets for those who choose to cycle and pedestrians, having increased air pollution, increased noise pollution particularly at night with cars who have no business being in the side streets? If I wasn't on my phone I could link some actual evidence but simple do some googling of LTN and you'll find they've been about for decades and in cities across Europe... And they work. It's facts Vs outrage bait.","Has anyone else had the nonsense, misleading, appeal to ignorance flyer through their door suggesting that the low traffic neighbourhood is bad for the environment?

2024-09-27 01:29:59,Low traffic neighbourhood PCN,"Low traffic neighbourhood PCN Just received a PCN for driving past one of those low traffic signs (didn't notice it at all, only 1small one on the side VS the usual 2 big stands). This was 2 blocks away from where I live, as a local resident am I able to get it waived?

It just seems ridiculous that I need to drive a good distance, in traffic, in the wrong direction away from my destination, when I live literally 300m away.

Other points to note:
+ I was driving a Zipcar rental, so can't apply for a blue badge. But again as a local resident is the only way to be able to drive directly home is if I own my own car?? Is it not enough that I live here? And pay taxes here?
+ On the appeal form it said I had to be the ""keeper"" of the car penalised,  it's not enough to be the driver on the penalty. What? I can be name and fined, but I can't appeal even if I commited the infraction? There's no logic or reason to this I can see","Just received a PCN for driving past one of those low traffic signs (didn't notice it at all, only 1small one on the side VS the usual 2 big stands).

The feeling of a cycle quiet way already happens in some small pockets in NYC, those that have winding streets or dead ends nearby. 

An interesting example of a model that could be used to replicate this is the closed street in the 90s on the east side. I forget the specific street, but it's a crosstown lane closed to traffic for one block. With this small closure, the rest of the street is naturally quieter because it's not used for through traffic. 

This is to say that you don't need a complete open street like Berry Street in order to create calmer traffic conditions.","For me, one of the things that made cycling in London so easy was the lack of parking. I could ride close the curb even in heavy traffic areas.
