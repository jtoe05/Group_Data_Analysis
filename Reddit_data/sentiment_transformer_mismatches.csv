But the UK system has local authorities begging central government and competing against one another for the infrastructure funding to do it, and they never get enough to do everything at once, thus they've got to try and solve both the too-many-cars and buses-not-good-enough problems separately, sometimes years apart.

For the most part, it does actually work. Before it was introduced the usual suspects bemoaned it would ""the death of independent businesses"" (which didn't happen ofcourse). 

That said, where Gent's version falls apart a bit is that despite this having been introduced, there has been basically zero investment in further public transport infrastructure. Also, since more traffic now goes over major trunk roads like the R40 (the ring road around the centre) and N430, the traffic lights are poorly timed so you end up driving from one red light to another very often which in turn, creates traffic jams during rush hour.",0.434670060873032,Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/q14zzi/birmingham_to_become_a_supersized_lowtraffic/hfgdp6q/,,Neutral,,Neutral,Positive

Based on comparisons of more than a decade of road casualty statistics between 113 London LTNs and other roads that did not have them, the report’s authors found that LTNs were associated with a 35% reduction in all injuries, rising to 37% for deaths and serious injuries.

In absolute terms, the study concluded, this meant that creating the LTNs prevented more than 600 road injuries that would have otherwise taken place, including 100 involving death or serious injury.",-0.293277617543936,Neutral,https://www.reddit.com/search.json/r/GoodNewsUK/comments/1lu23kz/londons_lowtraffic_zones_cut_deaths_and_injuries/,low traffic neighbourhood,Positive,,Positive,Neutral
