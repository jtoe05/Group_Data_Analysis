There's evidence that people self report cycling and walking more, but it doesn't seem to be massively statistically pronounced.

I may have sounded like I am against any and all traffic reduction schemes, but this is not the case. I do think it's a good idea, but I think if you're going to direct all traffic down a main road away from rat runs then you should also consider adding an extra lane to that road or other upgrades.

I don't think simply increasing journey times is a very good strategy, I think it should be attacked the other way by making it easier to use other forms of travel and just mainly leaving the car the fuck alone.

I then placed some modal filters at some junctions (and other strategic points), to allow only cycles and pedestrians through. This should hopefully reduce traffic in this area, as it has in all my other LTNs.

I also replaced a vehicle bridge with two separate cycle and pedestrian bridges (last image)

How did I do? What other improvements can I make city-wide to help cyclists and pedestrians? How else can I improve my LTNs?

P.S. bus services are still running normally through this LTN, and are servicing the area well, without any significant delays. In fact, the reduced traffic from the LTN will hopefully \*increase\* bus timings.

2022-04-27 14:17:46,"Inuit residential care centre Larga Baffin faces angry opposition from councillor Diane Deans I had the extreme displeasure of attending a public information session last night on the Larga Baffin proposal on Hunt Club road.

Larga Baffin is a Inuit owned residential care centre for people travelling from Nunavut to Ottawa for emergency medical care unavailable at home, including treatment for cancer and heart disease. Nunavut only has one hospital and they have a huge nursing shortage and low capacity to deal with the medical concerns of residents, so they often fly to Ottawa for care.

Larga Baffin have spent the past 6 years searching for suitable property for a new building. They are currently located on Richmond Road but they are far from hospitals and the airport, and they have to overflow clients to nearby hotels because they don't have enough space. The new proposed location is much closer to the airport and medical facilities, and it's a designed community to support the people travelling for care, rather than an old retrofitted building like where they currently are.

I personally met with Diane Deans on this proposal a couple months, because I saw her opposition to it based on ""traffic"" and ""size"" and ""greenspace"" — the usual NIMBY red flags.

She literally told me that she was concerned it was going to be like the Salvation Army build in Vanier and she was worried that it was going to lead to Indigenous homeless people flooding her neighbourhood.

Keep in mind this is a sitting city councillor who is running for mayor... I was absolutely aghast then, and I still am.

I sat in on the public meeting last night and could not believe the anger and hostility from local residents, whipped into a fury by their city councillor.

Now, she publicly has reverted to claiming that the project is ""grossly oversized"" (the surrounding area is zoned for 6 storey and 9 storey builds — this is a 6 storey proposal) and she is concerned about a huge traffic impact (Hunt Club is a major arterial road, none of these people are bringing cars from Nunavut, and they have medical shuttles to get to and from appointments that serve the community).

Some of the comments at the public meeting were incredibly gross — people asked about the amount of crime this facility would bring, or how we could keep these people out of their local parks — but I wanted to highlight one in particular, which best summarizes the privilege and lack of self-awareness demonstrated by the NIMBY group angry about this project.

[https://twitter.com/DeanTester/status/1519139010324664322](https://twitter.com/DeanTester/status/1519139010324664322)

""I spent a lot of money on this house... WE ARE HERE FIRST!""

I cannot imagine how ignorant a person would have to be to tell a group of Inuit people to stay out of the neighbourhood because you think you were there first... but that's where we're at. Unfortunately, there were 250+ people on this Zoom call last night, and almost all of them were just this angry about the proposal.

If you're like me, you probably don't think that a small group of angry, wealthy homeowners, who only care about their property value, should be able to block a residential care home for desperate Inuit people, here's what you can do:

1. Tweet at dianedeans on Twitter or email her at [diane.deans@ottawa.ca](mailto:diane.deans@ottawa.ca) and let her know you want to see Larga Baffin get their new build as soon as possible, so the Inuit community can receive the world class medical care they deserve.
2. Send your feedback to the City of Ottawa through the DevApps portal — let them know you support this project! [https://devapps.ottawa.ca/en/applications/D01-01-21-0022/details](https://devapps.ottawa.ca/en/applications/D01-01-21-0022/details)
3. Email, call, or tag on social media the chairs of the planning committee — Scott Moffat and Glen Gower — and contact the other members as well, urging them to ignore the NIMBY campaign and approve this project: [https://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/council-committees-and-boards/committees-and-boards/planning-committee](https://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/council-committees-and-boards/committees-and-boards/planning-committee)

I'm really enraged to be honest. The first attempt at one in the city, with actually really limited changes to the traffic flow, on roads that I cycle on and get forced to stop because ""Mr look how big my balls are"" in his car or van has to prove a point. (Even though council tax pays for roads). 

It's so sad that this presumably funded pro-car-flyer has been distributed to encourage people to ""stop the forced LTN"" that will supposedly ""destroy Hanover"" has been circulated and I worry that it will lead to lots of car owners leaving feedback and lots of non car users, pedestrians, cyclists... Parents... Not actually leaving positive feedback. 

A low traffic neighbourhood will be better for people with sensory disabilities, those that cycle and can commute to work or to the station via bike without the worry of for example half asleep drivers blasting their horn at you as they speed down a side street, for those with kids who want to stretch their legs without the constant flow of traffic. The entire point is that cars can still get to their location via a road that is built to sustain the volume of traffic. For example where is there traffic lights and crossings in Hanover? I have also done some simple searches and the idea that the traffic will continue to be higher of the routes around Hanover is debunked, people in low traffic neighbourhoods tend to embrace the change and abandon their car (to some extent)

Ultimately are you in favour of trying and maybe failing, or are you in favour of not trying and sticking with business as usual, all the while having unsafe streets for those who choose to cycle and pedestrians, having increased air pollution, increased noise pollution particularly at night with cars who have no business being in the side streets?
