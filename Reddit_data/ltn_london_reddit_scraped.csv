comment,,2025-05-23 17:16:30,"I enjoyed watching the anti-LTN protests in my neighbourhood dwindle from 50-60 down to 2 adults and a child, over the course of 6 months. 

Their finest moment was driving a massive New York taxi up onto the pavement on our local high street one busy weekend, in order to…assert the dominance of the car? I don’t know.

Their lowest point was closing down a council meeting with their appalling behaviour. That and the violent language directed towards councillors, myself and other locals, the bigotry, and sundry insults. That’s all they have, the people who want to drive their cars anywhere and everywhere; bad faith, lies, insults and threats. Apparently I’m a Stalinist, and a Nazi.

comment,,2020-09-12 16:37:51,"Agreed. It might be poorly executed and ill thought out but no amount of public consultation will change the fact that this is something that needs to happen. The idea isn't to make a small number of arterial roads jam packed with cars - the idea is to make a small number of arterial roads so jam packed with cars that people wake up and go 'fuck this, I'm not using my car'. Every protester I saw today was talking about care workers and disabled access, as though this is the critical argument that must be considered in combatting climate change...

Roads to every front door cannot remain the norm. Workaround solutions must absolutely be provided for the elderly and disabled, but not at the cost of derailing green progress.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/ird6cy/march_in_northfields_to_protest_the_setup_of_new/g4xl5o1/,,March in Northfields to protest the setup of new LTN (Low Traffic Neighbourhood) without public consultation
comment,,2020-09-12 18:18:18,"It bothers me when people who couldn’t give less of a shit about disabled people use us as a reason to oppose sensible changes. I’m a wheelchair user and while I can’t speak for all disabled people (as many do need to use a car to get from a-b for a large variety of reasons), life is better for me when public transport is abundant and efficient. For a lot of people who can’t use public transport, it’s because it’s not accessible. If I need a car to get between home and wherever I’m going it’s cos there’s no lift at the station or the buses won’t put the ramp out. So it’s a straw man argument to suggest that low traffic neighbourhoods are discriminatory against vulnerable people, because jam packed roads make it really hard for disabled people to get around too. 

If they cared that much they’d be campaigning for a better welfare state or improved access or literally ANYTHING more relevant to our lives.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/ird6cy/march_in_northfields_to_protest_the_setup_of_new/g4xyfhh/,,March in Northfields to protest the setup of new LTN (Low Traffic Neighbourhood) without public consultation
comment,,2020-09-12 22:20:50,"Also, making public transport highly accessible helps everyone.

Sure, an uninjured, youthful body wouldn't notice, but when you break your leg or are pushing through chemo treatments or are helping a friend with mobility issues, it's good to have accessible transport even for people who wouldn't consider themselves to have a physical disability.

it's just good social practice to make everything as accessible as possible.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/ird6cy/march_in_northfields_to_protest_the_setup_of_new/g4z19i0/,,March in Northfields to protest the setup of new LTN (Low Traffic Neighbourhood) without public consultation
comment,,2020-09-13 11:41:56,"Exactly. I lived in the Netherlands for a while and it was really noticeable and pleasing to see how the cycle infrastructure also benefited wheelchair users - lots of people bombing along on those setups with handcranks. No need to worry about paths suddenly ending or big curb stones to negotiate, and of course most bridges either have a low gradient slope or a lift to get on or off.

post,Should all of central London become one giant LTN?,2025-06-05 17:52:17,"I’m 100% serious. 

Central London is completely and utterly overstuffed with vehicles, and it’s a nightmare to travel through at the best of times - and that’s to say nothing about the pollution and lung destruction caused, the completely unnecessary traffic deaths, and the insane noise and stress that comes from just being exposed to that.

LTNs and pedestrianised zones are a *literal* breath of fresh air - no more having to worry about getting crushed by a speeding two tonne steel Kevin- or Karen-mobile.

Plus, without personal automobiles, there would be SO much more room for cyclists, which would also mean more room for pedestrians as we could expand the pavements.

Remember, cycling is a the most popular form of transportation in London now, the one least likely to cause the death of fellow road users. 

Clearly, there will need to be exceptions - blue badge holders, emergency vehicles and the like. Busses too, but even those would benefit since there would be virtually zero other traffic to contend with. Delivery drivers could be allowed only outside of peak hours (before 8am, let’s say)

Just the other day in my area, a driver was speeding at 40mph in a 20mph main road, and careened around a corner and hit another car and crushed 3 pedestrians agains the shopfront he ran them into. The paramedics had to literally salt the road to prevent the bloodstains from soaking in. 

I don’t  mean to be graphic, but this is the reality of living in a city congested with cars. 

So why not make it virtually impossible to drive one unless for the aforementioned exceptional circumstances?

Why keep allowing cars to take the piss?

EDIT: pedestrianisation would likely cause an economic boom amongst small businesses in those areas it was implemented as your footfall would be so much higher 

EDIT: yes, i’m fully aware this will either get downvoted to hell or become one of the most “controversial” posts on this subreddit - but i’ll steel man this position till the cows come home

comment,,2025-02-12 15:08:39,"Its a really rough topic, because LTNs are almost always opposed more beforehand and then supported after implementation. People also have biases for how bad traffic will get on main roads, and how much shops depend on car trips (they often don’t and there’s some interesting research on London that suggests this is hugely overestimated).

This means there’s a clash between people and evidence. The best way is typically to trial a scheme and then if a permanent method (which likely functions a little better and looks better since it’s not cheaply thrown in).",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/1inq8ms/hostile_west_dulwich_ltn_meeting_left_councillors/mcd7ynu/,,"Hostile West Dulwich LTN meeting 'left councillors in tears with traumatised staff offered leave', High Court told"

comment,,2025-02-12 22:02:42,"Newham have now done 7 and are getting pretty good at the consultation. Still got total nutjobs online and pretty good 'anti' coordination but the robust comms from the council helps. 

https://www.newham.gov.uk/transport-streets/low-traffic-neighbourhood/8

&gt; In 2021 we received a petition to ‘restrict rat running’ in the West Ham Park area, so we looked into the traffic data and found that half of the traffic in the area was not local, but rather, traffic using the neighbourhood as a shortcut. We looked into road safety statistics and found that there was on average, a casualty every 15 days over a four-year period.

&gt; The use of enforcement cameras and issuing fines is to prevent motor vehicles from driving through modal filters whilst allowing exempted motor vehicles to drive through. The main alternative to camera enforcement would be moveable gates or bollards, but consultation with police, fire and ambulance services shows this is not their preferred option and barriers would slow down their vehicles when every second counts in an emergency.

&gt; In Newham’s other LTNs, four of the five LTNs experienced a reduction in boundary road traffic by the end of the experimental scheme. There is also research from University of Westminster which monitored the 46 most recent LTN schemes in London and found that there was little change in boundary road traffic. It is important to note that we are not using these data to make assumptions about changes to traffic resulting from the West Ham Park LTN, but rather to demonstrate that it is reasonable to run an experimental scheme and to monitor traffic data closely.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/1inq8ms/hostile_west_dulwich_ltn_meeting_left_councillors/mcfmu2h/,,"Hostile West Dulwich LTN meeting 'left councillors in tears with traumatised staff offered leave', High Court told"

I think sometimes the main road route will be slower, but more reliable. When you push a massive amount of traffic down tiny back streets in between cars, it doesn't take much to cause absolute mayhem.

*I publish newsletters covering everything local councils do each week.*

*I set up this project because local authorities spend about 12% of the UK government budget, or roughly 5p of every pound that's earned in the UK, and yet the vast majority of people have no idea who their local councillors are, or what they're currently doing. I think that's bad for our society.*

post,How do you feel about Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in your borough?,2020-09-09 11:47:44,"So LTN's are popping up around London. 

The point is that they are supposed to reduce the dominance of cars in residential areas and allow journeys to be more easily made via cycling, walking and public transport. There are many places in London where they have existed for decades but it's argued that GPS, increasing numbers of cars, increasing numbers of cyclists and the need for physical distancing has made it more urgent.

However as a result some car journeys may be longer and there are claims that traffic and pollution is made worse on main roads - where people also live.

There is also large scale opposition from many black taxi drivers who are accustomed to using back streets to avoid traffic which may no longer be possible.

What's your view and it would be good to know how you travel around London?

post,Low Traffic Neighbourhood trials suspended - Wandsworth,2020-09-11 18:39:31,"Wandsworth Council is to suspend its Low Traffic Neighbourhood (LTN) trials following a high level review.

The LTN trials were introduced last month to make residential streets more bike and pedestrian friendly and to deter rat run traffic.  


They were part of a series of measures introduced as part of the COVID response by freeing up additional space on the highway in support of social distancing and to promote alternative forms of travel as people gradually return to work.

The trials also supported the council’s ambition of combating climate change by encouraging people to use more sustainable forms of transport and tackling air quality.

However an initial review of the trials has identified concerns with emergency access and traffic flows. And this has been compounded by additional changes that Transport for London (TfL) is making to red route roads in the borough.  


These include significant interventions on the A24 (Balham High Road to Tooting High Street and beyond) including moving bus stops, installing cycle lane segregation, banning turns at a number of junctions and removing parking.

The scale of these A24 changes coinciding with the council’s efforts to establish LTNs on residential streets has caused confusion and long traffic queues.

Additionally, concerns around rising COVID rates and reduced capacity on public transport has meant that alternative travel options are limited for many people at this time.

In light of these initial trial findings the council has decided to suspend the LTN trials.

Wandsworth Council’s cabinet member for strategic planning and transportation, Cllr John Locker said: “We have monitored the traffic flows and listened to feedback from residents and businesses. We have also spoken to our partners including local hospitals and key services to hear the impact on them.

“It is clear that the LTNs are not delivering the benefits we want to see. In fact it looks like the combination of changes in areas like Tooting, where TfL are making changes to the main high road, are unfortunately having the opposite effect. That is why we have taken the difficult decision to pause and re-think about how we can achieve our objective of delivering healthier, safer streets.”

He added: “We all want to do what is right environmentally, whilst maintaining people’s ability to travel and making sure town centres and high streets function properly. It’s important that we listen to what people are saying so that we get this right.”

The Council will continue to review the impact of TfL’s road changes to the A24 in Balham and Tooting to see if the issues improve over the coming weeks.

comment,,2020-09-12 10:53:03,"It's easy to get consultation responses from noisy minorities. Motorists and cyclists can sometimes indentify very strongly with their mode of transport. Pedestrians? Not so much. Children who can't safely walk to school, who can't play in their street, are they going to up and form a local campaigning organisation to represent their interests? Of course not. But they are hugely affected by the dominance of motor traffic.

I do think that it's up to councils to weather any initial angry response and show leadership - particularly if they were elected on manifestos which stated they would encourage walking and cycling. They shouldn't judge the response by how busy their inbox is now, but by how busy it is once everyone has got used to the changes. I bet councillors in Hackney never get emails asking them to rip out bollards put in place back in the 70s, put it that way...

edit - re the mention of manifestos, [this snippet](https://twitter.com/Jo_Earlsfield/status/1304699461046882304) from the Wandsworth Tories' election material in 2018 is interesting.

You wouldn't get people getting fined because it's impossible to read the fucking signs, and residents can still access the road and a few local people could still go and park on the road if they needed to, or you know visit a friend who lives on the road, or pick their nan up in their car to take her to the shops, and you could still put your benches and stuff up. 

And you wouldn't even get anti green car users protesting ""green zones"". it would just be another dead end road, end of story.

So you'll get the same result with non of the cost or problems.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/15stv97/fixing_vandalised_ltn_infrastructure_costs_london/jwgedox/,,"Fixing vandalised LTN infrastructure costs London councils more than £850,000 | Low-traffic neighbourhoods"

comment,,2021-06-03 12:05:02,"I'm an LTN supporter but some of the ""evidence"" in the early part of that article was thin at best.

You can't divine from ward voting patterns of Con v Lab whether people supported an LTN or not. That's ridiculous given what is going on in national politics and the fact that both Shaun Bailey and Sadiq Khan are, in their own ways, divisive candidates. Even in somewhere where LTNs were a big issue like Ealing and where even some Labour politicians like Rupa Huq came out as anti LTN.

About the best one can conclude is that they aren't a major vote loser.

Once it became clear that Shaun Bailey would lose it was a slam dunk on for Labour pro-cycling types to treat the elections as a referendum on LTNs. Arguably, for a candidate as poor as Bailey, his improved showing in polls, which was higher than predicted, could equally be attributed to his anti-LTN stance.

There are much better arguments to be made for the popularity of LTNs, including evidence from Walthamstow and the fact that nobody is militating to remove the thousands of LTNs that already exist.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/nqjz0s/low_traffic_neighbourhoods_popular_with_london/h0f711j/,,"Low traffic neighbourhoods popular with London voters, analysis finds"

""LTNs block roads""  

Her evidence for that is a taxi driver complaining about it to her. There's no evidence for that at all. Roads have been busier, but it's due to more drivers as people avoid public transport (as shown [in Sustrans' overview of LTN research](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/for-professionals/infrastructure/an-introductory-guide-to-low-traffic-neighbourhood-design/an-introductory-guide-to-low-traffic-neighbourhood-design-contents/design-guide/all/5-a-guide-to-the-evidence-around-low-traffic-neighbourhoods).  

""They prevent injuries, but that's not important as it's obvious"" 

I really don't understand that argument. Is it even an argument?  

""They generate too many fines""  

Good. People should pay attention to road signs. Whether that's LTN signs or 20mph speed limits or whatever else.  

""It's bad because the Conservatives are now investing money in active travel""  

Another one I really don't understand.

People are still avoiding public transport, so traffic is higher than it was pre-pandemic. I hope this changes soon, the risk doesn't seem very high what with how many people are vaccinated and mask wearing still being mandatory. Plus TfL badly needs the money from fares of course.

The consultations for the most part were hampered by the need to move quickly.

**[Lambeth](https://opencouncil.network/councils/lambeth)** - The Lambeth Country Show is set to return to Brockwell Park, but not without some debate! Councillors granted conditional planning permission, addressing concerns about the impact on the park's heritage and local residents. Meanwhile, the council's pension fund is underperforming, with councillors discussing potential changes to investment strategy. On a brighter note, a Latin American weight management program is seeing impressive results, with 83% of participants losing weight!

**[Lewisham](https://opencouncil.network/councils/lewisham)** - Lewisham Council is getting a constitution refresh, with changes proposed to everything from local assemblies to financial procedure rules. Meanwhile, the Licensing Committee is grappling with applications for new alcohol licenses, facing objections from residents concerned about antisocial behaviour and public nuisance.

**[Southwark](https://opencouncil.network/councils/southwark)** - South Dock Marina is set for a major redevelopment, with plans for new workshops, studios, and a 50-tonne crane. But not everyone is happy, with concerns raised about the loss of a community garden and restrictions on sleeping on boats. Meanwhile, a plan to build new sports facilities at Dulwich Sports Club has been withdrawn. The council is also focusing on its ""Delivering Southwark 2030"" strategy, aiming for a fairer, greener, and safer borough.

**[Wandsworth](https://opencouncil.network/councils/wandsworth)** - A proposed 24/7 alcohol delivery service is causing a stir in Wandsworth, with residents and councillors worried about noise and traffic. The Licensing Sub-Committee is also reviewing the license for a shop on Mitcham Road, but the details are shrouded in secrecy due to an ongoing police investigation. Meanwhile, the Conservation and Heritage Advisory Committee is battling over a mansard roof extension, arguing it would detract from the character of the Parktown Conservation Area.

**[Newham](https://opencouncil.network/councils/newham)** - Newham is facing some tough decisions, including a potential school closure. The Cabinet has agreed to consult on the future of Calverton Primary School, a move described as ""really difficult."" On the financial front, the council is selling off assets to generate £51.2 million in capital receipts. But it's not all doom and gloom, with Newham set to receive millions in funding to support low-income households and improve sexual health services.

**[Islington](https://opencouncil.network/councils/islington)** - A plan to build a new dwelling at the rear of 49 Richmond Avenue has been rejected, with councillors citing concerns about design, sustainability, and fire safety. But a similar application for a dwelling at 4-6 Shaftesbury Road has been approved, albeit with some amended conditions. Meanwhile, the Licensing Sub Committee is considering a premises licence variation for The Archway, with concerns raised about planning permission and smoke-free regulations.

**[Westminster](https://opencouncil.network/councils/westminster)** - Westminster's Licensing Sub-Committee is wrestling with a trio of licensing applications, facing objections from residents concerned about antisocial behaviour and the impact on their neighbourhoods. From a new off-license on Churton Street to a co-working space on Welbeck Street and a members club on Harrow Road, each case presents its own unique challenges.

**[Waltham Forest](https://opencouncil.network/councils/waltham-forest)** - Waltham Forest is going green with its climate-focused brand, Kanopiworks, aiming to become a local trusted retrofit provider. Meanwhile, the council is facing budget pressures, leading to a review of the Fairer Contributions Policy and a proposal to end school catering service level agreements. The council is also grappling with housing repairs and maintenance, aiming to improve its service for residents.

**[Greenwich](https://opencouncil.network/councils/greenwich)** - Greenwich Council is on the hunt for a new Director of Legal and Democratic Services, a crucial role for ensuring the legality of the council's decisions. The Appointments Panel has been busy interviewing candidates behind closed doors.

**[Tower Hamlets](https://opencouncil.network/councils/tower-hamlets)** - Tower Hamlets is focusing on improving children's services, with the Children and Education Scrutiny Sub-Committee discussing safeguarding, educational attainment, and free school meals. The sub-committee is also sending a report on free school meals to the Mayor and Cabinet. Meanwhile, the council is seeking a Strategic Director, Change and Improvement, a key role for meeting Ministerial Directions. The Overview &amp; Scrutiny Committee has been grilling the Mayor on everything from customer service to homelessness.

I think that's bad for our society.*

post,It's Freedom Day tomorrow,2021-07-18 20:12:17,"So, /r/London, after 24 posts about the restrictions changing in England and Greater London over the last 16 months, legal restrictions are coming to an end. You can think what you wish about the timing, and how bad our third wave might get, and what'll happen in the winter, but facts are the laws expire tomorrow. So here's what you can and can't do from midnight tonight:

### Social contact

- 🏠 No more restrictions on where you can meet (indoors or outdoors)
- 👽 No more restrictions on who you can meet
- 👪 No more restrictions on how many people you can meet
- 🤗 Social distancing is a matter of personal judgement

### Activities

- 🕺 Everything that's already open obviously stays open. The main change is that Nightclubs can now reopen. Mass events such as gigs, music festivals, the cinema, theatre and sports are no-longer subject to capacity limits or licensing under the health laws.

- 🍻 You can buy a drink and stand at the bar again in pubs, although many pubs and restaurants will continue to take bookings because people seem to like it. Outdoor terraces may be a permanent fixture!

- 📘 Schools, colleges and universities are largely on summer holidays currently, so while they're 'back', they're not 'back'. 

- 🏢 Don't expect to be rushing back to the office any time soon. Many large companies have said they have no intention of returning to full time face to face and are downsizing their floor space as a result. Who knows what the next year will bring on that front!

- 🚗 Low traffic neighbourhood (LTN) schemes (those annoying or beneficial local road closures, depending on your point of view) will continue to operate, the trial introduced during the pandemic is not expiring yet.

### Vaccine passports

The government has suggested venues such as nightclubs and indoor gigs should use the vaccine passport if they can. It will be up to venues whether they decide to do, but if you've had both jabs, you can download the NHS app [[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nhs-app/id1388411277), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nhs.online.nhsonline&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US)] and find your pass there. This is a different app to the NHS COVID-19 app. Alternatively you will be able to show evidence of a recent negative test if you've not had both jabs yet.

### Mask Wearing

Wearing a mask is no-longer legally required anywhere, and it is not an offence to not wear one. **However**, businesses, private properties and other entities serving the public are free to continue to require masks if they wish.

Of particular note:

- 🚌 **Transport for London** will continue to require masks on all of its tube services, bus services, and on any stations that it manages. While National Rail has not followed suit, it may be difficult to know where one ends and the other begins, so perhaps just wear it all the way? The **British Transport Police** enforce UK laws as well as railway bylaws, so can and will enforce mask policy and you can be denied travel if you don't follow the policy.

- 🚕 **Uber** continues to operate their no mask, no ride policy. Other services may follow suit. Black cabs are not under any such requirement though, and drivers are free to decide whether to ask passengers to wear a mask.

- 🏥 **NHS hospitals, clinics and surgeries** will continue to require masks indoors

- 🛒 **Major supermarkets** are recommending but not requiring that masks are worn inside their stores

- 💈My local barber have said they will continue to require masks during haircuts. Any business can do this if they wish, and refuse you service and have the police remove you for **criminal trespass** if you don't follow their instructions. Don't mess around folks. Just be nice.

### Contact tracing, self isolation and app pings

If you experience coronavirus symptoms you must still [self isolate](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/when-to-self-isolate-and-what-to-do/) as must your household. 

You may be contacted by someone from _Test and Trace_ asking you to self isolate, or you might get pinged by the NHS COVID-19 app [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nhs-covid-19/id1520427663), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.nhs.covid19.production&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US)] if you've been near someone who had the virus. These are legal instructions that you must follow.

Your employer should understand their responsibilities here and pay you contracted or statutory sick pay, but you can also seek [extra financial support](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/help-and-financial-support-while-youre-self-isolating/) if you find yourself in hardship.

A lot of people are going to end up in self isolation over the next month. The government may change the rules for those who are fully vaccinated, but the self isolation laws may disrupt businesses unexpectedly, including public transport. Keep your eyes peeled.

### Get Jabbed

Everyone over 18 is now eligible for vaccination which can be [booked online](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/) or obtained at the many walk-in centres. You can also get your second jab various walk-in centres, check out /r/GetJabbed for more information.

### That's s a wrap

This may be our last coronavirus megathread. The restrictions will not be returning unless there's a sharp untick in hospitalisations that threatens the NHS' ability to cope. Certainly, I'm sure we all hope things don't get that bad again.

I know some of you have suffered terribly during the last 16 months, whether with your personal physical or mental health, with losing someone close to you, with losing your job or your house/flat because of the pandemic, or the breakdown of relationships and friendships over this very tough period, or being separated from friends and family due to borders or tiers or bubbles or whatever.

Through these rough days, /r/london has been a ray of sunshine and I wanted to thank each and every one of our members who've posted something that's helped someone else, either directly or just because your sarcasm, brutal honesty, and shitty photos of the Shard have brightened some very dark days. 

Keep doing what you're doing please!

post,How should we make alternative modes to cars better?,2022-03-29 08:44:50,"Driving in London can often be the best choice for a trip, but half of households don’t own a car and if they did traffic would be even worse. Of course, alternatives are less congestion/polluting/noisy/dangerous… So

How should we as a city enable people to drive when they need to whilst making sure alternatives are typically a better option. Driving can make busses unreliable, cycling unsafe, and walking unpleasant, so something has to give to make these appealing.

Currently we have:

• ULEZ and congestion charge

•LTNs - Low traffic neighbourhoods where you can only drive for access

• Pedestrianised areas

• Cycle and Bus lanes

So what would you do? What would you change to alleviate traffic whilst still letting people drive when they need to?",88,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/tqtq37/how_should_we_make_alternative_modes_to_cars/,low traffic neighbourhood,

comment,,2022-03-29 09:21:33,"Normalise renting a car for the couple of days you need it, instead of owning one outright for the whole year.

Yes, sometimes you need to transport something heavy or travel out into the country, and a car is the best choice for that. But for all the other days of the year when you aren't doing that, owning a car full time is just a money sink and better alternatives exist. You end up using it to drive half a mile to the corner shop because the car is there and its convenient. This isn't an exaggeration - Two thirds of all car journeys in London are under 2 miles, and half of those are under *one* mile.

Renting is cheaper - you don't need to maintain it while its sitting idle in the street, it won't get the wing mirrors knocked off or sideswiped by a van, and you don't lose any money on depreciation. You don't need to keep up to date on the MOT or tax disc. And you can rent a nicer car than you can own, too, which makes the drive more enjoyable. You lose the flexibility of being able to pick up the keys and drive somewhere, but I'd much rather have an extra £5,000 a year in my pocket. And if you care about your carbon footprint, the built environment, air quality, the obesity epidemic, traffic fatalities and NHS backlogs, or the economy, you're doing far more damage to those causes than you realise.

And the more people choose to abandon their cars, the better the alternatives for driving will become.

post,Impassable bus shelter on narrow pavement,2024-09-26 11:43:40,"I recently moved to a new neighbourhood, and my local bus stop is driving me crazy. I've never seen a bus stop with so little room for pedestrians to pass, and it's honestly dangerous on the busy road.

The shelter is placed a couple feet from the edge of the kerb as usual, so if you're carrying shopping or anything it's difficult to pass without stepping into the busy street. If anyone is waiting for a bus and not sitting on the bench, they completely block the path. 

Normally that's fine, because passing pedestrians would walk behind the shelter. But here a pub's front garden blocks the way, with a low wall built within inches of the back of the shelter. If the shelter was just a few meters to the left or right there wouldn't be an issue, as the other shops don't jut out like the pub.

The stop is on a high traffic road and serves multiple routes, including one of the new superloop routes. There are multiple stops along the same road served by all the same buses, except the superloop which is an express so this is the only one within walking distance. That makes it the most crowded stop around here, yet it's the one with least room.

How on earth did TfL screw this up so badly? I've lived in London for a decade and never seen another bus shelter so badly placed. Maybe the pub extended their wall after it was built?

We have quite a few in our area but not down our road and since they implemented them we are now taking all the traffic that would have previously spread across multiple roads, as a result its difficult to cross the road at times. It doesn't appear to have reduced traffic just displaced it. 

We're campaigning locally to try and extend the scheme but apparently our local ward councillor is against it (hence us being excluded in the first place) and it's starting to feel like it would be easier to campaign against the whole thing.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/wkuvxn/what_is_going_on/ijzgrjl/,,What is going on?

\&gt; ""But those in charge of vehicles that can cause the greatest harm in the event of a collision bear the greatest responsibility to take care and reduce the danger they pose to others. ""

  
In nearly every European country, this would say ""the vehicle that can cause the greatest harm is automatically to blame in the event of a collision."" or words to that effect.

Ours is incredibly watered down and just says ""the vehicle that can cause the greatest harm have the responsibility \*to take care\*"".

So they did a full consultation, reaching basically EVERYONE in the ward, distributing so much paperwork... the people against it were on Nextdoor and Twitter making it look like they were going to tank the proposal, then barely anyone from their side responded to the consultation. 

And that's when they claimed that the consultation was racist.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/lvxo5s/wonder_what_argument_theyll_come_up_with_next/gpee81z/,,Wonder what argument they’ll come up with next against LTN...

Middle aged white cyclists don’t need cycle lanes, as they’re already out on their bikes, facing down reckless drivers.

comment,,2021-03-02 18:17:58,"Cycling is still weighted towards men and particularly white men. No shit though - until recently, cycling was more like a bloodsport in London. It was actively hostile to slow and unconfident cyclists. It still is. I get a proper old skool close pass maybe once a week now but it's enough to put you off.

I started cycling in London when literally the only people who commuted were bike freaks, couriers, sandal wearers and a minority of lycra'ed up club guys. People used to look at you slack jawed if you told them you cycled across London.

Some years after I started cycling in London I remember joining a mass bike ride to protest a lethal section of road that was notorious for cycle fatalities. This was maybe 2 years after the first cycle superhighways were put in and they were still basically just some blue paint on the road. Cycling commuters were *still* a tiny minority. In my organisation of 500 maybe 10 people cycled in. We had a dedicated bike storage, showers etc.

Anyway it's funny when cabbies call cycling race/class exclusive. Sure, mate. I can count the number of ethnic minority black cab drivers I've seen on one hand. Pretty sure it's not the average London who's forking out £20 to go half the distance for twice the price of an Uber.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/lvxo5s/wonder_what_argument_theyll_come_up_with_next/gpfniwj/,,Wonder what argument they’ll come up with next against LTN...

There is the additional related argument that it is the richer neighbourhoods (which tend to be whiter) that benefit, while the poorer (ethnically diverse) neighbourhoods suffer.

post,How to reduce car trafic in London ?,2022-10-31 16:32:59,"We've all seen a fair bit of news about the just stop oil protesters painting everything orange lately.

While I fully agree with them on the ""We need to stop burning fossil fuel"" front, I'm not sure the action they're taking are actually moving things forward.

I (maybe naively) believe democracy can work if people are willing to get involved, and I think Reddit may be a place where I can find such people.

I want to produce a documents with suggestion for solution when it comes to moving towards a fossil fuel free world that can be sent over to our MPs. If enough people reach out saying ""We want a sustainable future, we think this may be a solution, this are the sacrifices we're willing to make"", they should look into it and create policies to push society in this direction.

Here is my line of reasoning:

## 1 - We need to stop burning fossil fuels.

I'm not gonna elaborate too long on this one, I think everyone pretty much know what's up with global warming. For me the two scariest consequences letting the planet go warm are:

* We put our food system at risk. Humanity mostly feed on sugarcane, maize, rice and wheat [(Data from FAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_valuable_crops_and_livestock_products), if we canot grow them, either because it's too hot or because of storms / flood / fires, we're in trouble. Food insecurity often leads to conflict.
* Some places are gonna become literally unliveable. As in it's so hot the human body cannot regulate its temperature by sweating and just dies. This means people WILL relocate. We're gonna have a massive immigration crisis, and once again, not enough space or ressource will likely lead to conflict.

So in a nutshell, global warming is not just a warm winter with no snow at Christmas, it's possibly the collapse of civilised life as we know it.

## 2 - We cannot ""Just stop oil""

We're dependant on it at the moment. We URGENTLY need to find alternatives, be we cannot ""Just stop oil"" in an instant.

## 3 - It's better to reduce demand than supply

As said in point 2, we're dependant on oil and gas, so stopping supply would create all kind of problems, especially with the current cost of living crisis. What we can do is take steps to reduce demand. And I believe this can happen through clever policy design.

## 4 - We can get there through policy design

I believe the role of politicians is to design a set of rules that allows society to thrive by incentivising citizen to do the right thing. This is where the system is currently broken and needs to be fixed. The current state of things is that the personal car or the plane are usually cheaper than the train. Invert that, and people will naturally make the switch, without having to forbid anything (that is : no need to police people, they'll just do it because it makes sense).

&amp;#x200B;

**So now that I've given the context, here is my question. What are the policies that would help reduce motor trafic in London?** 

I'm especially interested in hearing from Londoner who drive, why do you drive, what's missing in the current public transport infrastructure that makes you need to drive? What would it take from the government / local council to make you give up on your car. 

I've been living in London for the last 4 years and I've never found myself in a situation where this was an insurmontable problem.

Here is what I came up with:

Extend the concept of the ""Low emission zone"" / ""Ultra low emission zone"" by introducing a ""No emission zone"". A No emission zone is an area that is meant to be closed to trafic, you could still drive through it for a fee, the same way you can still drive an older car through a ULEZ. This should  incentivise people to avoid these areas (I've seem that work with my friend who drive an older car and now avoid ULEZ). The obvious first place to try this out would be Richmond Park, then extend it to residential area, shopping street, etc.

In order for this to work, it would require a few things:

\- A very clear communication from the authority about why this is put in place. ""We're doing that because we want to reduce car traffic, for all the reason stated above, NOT because we want to suck money out of you"".

\- A very user friendly payement system, you should be able to link an account to your license plate and not have to worry about anything. You just get an email every now and then along the line of ""You've been charge £X last month for driving through the no emission zone, would it not be cheaper for you to take the bus / tube ?""

\- A progressively increasing fee. People push back on sudden change. If the government/council was to introduce a fee out of the blue, people would complain. I think the best way to go would be a month long communication campaign, explaining that we're gonna introduce a fee for driving through X area, fee will start at 1p on the 1st January, and increase by 10p every week. This is to make the change gradual, it gives people time to find alternatives, and it also lead the option to drive through available if you really need to.

All the money collected from the fee can then be re-injected to subsidise public transport. Making driving more expensive and public transport cheaper, hence creating a strong financial incentive for people to make the switch.

Let me know what you think.",70,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/yifdrk/how_to_reduce_car_trafic_in_london/,low-traffic zones,
comment,,2022-10-31 19:17:07,"The problem with climate change is that everyone agrees that its important to do something about it, but when you ask them to actually do something themselves to help, that's when the ""Oh, I didn't mean *I* should have to change"" excuses come out. All of these solutions are demonstrably positive, and yet politically impossible, because it has the gall to affect people.

Which means we need to look at how to make it politically tenable for people who don't have a thorough understanding of environmental urbanism and a degree in transportation engineering to accept they may be inconvenienced by environmental initiatives (perceived or otherwise) in order to protect the planet. Failing that, we need to counterbalance people who vote against environmentally friendly measures because they have to adapt to it, by supporting politicians who implement those policies.

The only way to do this is, in my view, for it to become a single-issue problem. Parties in your area that fall short of your expectations on environmental policy should not get your vote, *regardless of their positions on any other topic*. And that doesn't necessarily mean just the Greens, (though it might do), and may (unfortunately) involve some element of tactical voting (making FPTP an environmentally unfriendly political system, though that's a separate discussion).

&amp;nbsp;

And if you've opposed traffic calming measures in the past because of how it will affect you, I'm sorry, but we all need to be taking a look at the bigger picture. There are legitimate reasons why people might need to drive, but most journeys do not fall into this category (TFL put unnecessary journeys at about 70%). And if you do fall into the other 30%, support public transport initiatives to make it 20%.

[Cars are responsible for 70% of all air pollution in UK towns and cities](https://content.tfl.gov.uk/benefits-of-cycling-report.pdf#page=12). In 2008, air pollution was responsible for the [loss of 340,000 life-years](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/304641/COMEAP_mortality_effects_of_long_term_exposure.pdf) from people who died as a result of polluted air - and that's ignoring the loss of life-years due to crashes. This just can't continue.

Electric cars are not a solution - they may reduce tailpipe emissions, but being heavier than normal cars (because of the battery weight) they have *significantly* increased tyre particulate emissions, which are just as bad. Electric cars are a small improvement on a massive problem, nothing more.

&amp;nbsp;

Its incredibly easy to sit around pretending this is someone else's fault. Far more difficult to look at yourself and find where through your own actions you've been causing some of that damage all along. I don't blame anyone for doing that - people have other things going on in their lives - but if you start to consider where you could do better from now on, you may be surprised at how easy some of the changes were all along.

* Cycle more and drive less.

* Consider reducing your meat consumption (not necessarily cut to zero), and/or replacing some meat with fish.

* Avoid flying at all costs, especially where a train is available.

* Support local traffic calming measures, even if they disadvantage you.

* Write to your local MP - since so few people do it, one letter is often taken as the viewpoint of 1000 or so constituents. Especially do so if they've implemented an environmentally friendly policy that's getting complaints, or haven't implemented anything particularly environmentally friendly at all.

* Support public transport initiatives - *Strongly*.

* Reduce your consumption. Look around your house at all the junk you've collected over the years and never actually used - everything you're looking at required carbon emissions to build, pack, ship, advertise, and sell. For what use?

* Turn down the thermostat. 

* Discuss the problem and what you're doing with others, if you get the chance.

* If you do drive a car, fuel efficiency and weight should be your primary factors in choosing make and model, to the detriment of everything else. There's a small sect of the population who looks down on the people who drive those sorts of cars, but that sounds like their problem.

&amp;nbsp;

Living your life requires that you pollute the planet. There's nothing we can do about that for the moment, that's in the hands of the Government. But you can support the Government whenever it chooses to try and change that, because the thing holding the Government back is people complaining those changes changed something.

They just need to put the squeeze on people and either ban private cars outright apart from exceptional circumstances, or just make owning a car in London a completely joyless experience. Have an approved list of vehicles, require a yearly license for ownership and pedestrianise or ban private vehicles from vast swathes of the roads.

If you ensure that people are driving smaller, slower vehicles, the roads will be much safer for cycling.

post,Observations on flat hunting in London,2018-11-06 00:46:38,"I've just arrived in London from outside the UK a few weeks ago for work (long-term hire from overseas on an EU passport, sorry for stealing your jobs, trust me, they looked). I've landed a flat with my partner and I thought I might provide a bit of commentary on the process, for other newcomers who don't have an innate knowledge of how it works and what challenges they might face. So in no particular order...

First off, further context: we were not seeking to share. We wanted a full flat to ourselves, two bedrooms, with outdoor space (garden or terrace), in zone 2 or 3. And we had a few specific tube lines we were interested in being nearby, as they are a fairly low-impact commute for me.

You can certainly look on OpenRent, Zoopla, RightMove, etc., but don't expect to see a lot of the flats you see there. Some agents seem to leave good flats up to get your details. Other times they're just lazy. But regardless, good flats appear to move fast. Sometimes within a day of being posted, I imagine. Certainly within a week. Any place, especially if posted by an agent, that's on the web and that you can then arrange to see, probably has a good reason it's not been let: overpriced, stinks of mold, simultaneously faces a high street and backs onto an elevated tube line.

Speaking of agents, they're hard to avoid. Yes, they have terrible reputations. I think maybe some are better than others. Some were dicks and kept trying to show us places 20% above our hard price limit (which we didn't have to give them, and maybe that's why they kept doing this to us, but we were trying to save time) that were also far outside our preferred areas. For example, Ealing when we said Chiswick. But that said, some were very keen to help, only showed us things they thought we'd like (and that met our more concrete criteria, like number of bedrooms), and weren't offended when we told them we didn't want a place even if we'd only seen the front door. You will pay extra for their service, but it might be worth it, versus spending weeks and weeks trying to connect with individual landlords, who can be almost as shifty. Or more so.

Another thing we ended up doing - wandering our chosen areas on early evenings and Saturdays and looking at postings in agents' windows. None of the nice looking flats are left anyway. But at least you can hope that they're representative, and then register with the agent inside. 

This brings me to the most critical point. Agents really, really want your details. They're like head hunters. They thrive on having a book of properties and a book of prospective tenants, and matching them. If they have five properties and no potential tenants, they're fucked. Vice-versa, fucked. So they will pursue you. But once we found a place and told them to sod off, they were pleasant enough and haven't harassed us. And we ended up seeing three properties, all via agents, that we were ready to offer on. (We saw about 50 in total. Most were utter shit.) I think it was totally worthwhile to have them forwarding every new suitable property they had. We really started to do better in terms of the quality of properties after we reached this stage.

Expect to see: toilets in ridiculous places. Sinks in bedrooms. Fridges in living rooms. Mold. Mold. Mold. Dog shit on carpets. Broken appliances. Chipped paint. Dead bulbs. And keep in mind we weren't looking at student housing. Doors that open upwards or downwards. Windows that open into other flats. Whatever. You name it. The world of London residential real estate is a cornucopia of weird.

Oh, and the photos! Where I come from, the photos are taken with fisheye lenses to exaggerate the size of the property. Here they rarely are, because the photographer doesn't want a wide angle - it would give away just how small the place is when the walls closing in around her become visible in the frame. Or that fridge in the reception room would become apparent.

We did try to reach individual landlords. There were less of them. They had less flexible schedules (if an agent can get into a property, they'll show it to you that day). They wanted us to attend open houses the next Saturday and compete with other tenants. They were developers of renovated garden flats that, while finished nicely, had kitchens the size of the boot of a VW. So we didn't mind having a few agents get busy for us.

We signed up with multiple agents at multiple firms. Foxtons. Marsh and Parsons. Dexters. All the other smaller firms. Probably ten agencies in all, 15 agents that we spoke to more than once. Multiple that we spoke to only once. More that called and I didn't get around to calling back. My phone rang incessantly. At the end of the process, not counting the 20 messages back and forth with the agent we actually went with for a flat, I deleted 240 emails and 50 VMs. Plus texts. My partner a similar number. 

This was partly as well because I went on the rental websites and absolutely spammed messages on every listing that looked slightly of interest. This was a waste of time, for the aforementioned reasons. Much better to just register with a few agencies and let them show you around. Budget one hour per flat. Even if you only need five minutes to see the place, you need far more to get from their office to the flat in their Mini in traffic. Plus they'll often have the wrong key or need to pick it up from a colleague or rival. Current tenants may not let you in.

Then be ready to offer, but don't believe their bullshit about the market. Brexit is coming, after all. Demand a break on the rent. And if they say no dogs, fuck them.

So now we are moving into a flat that seems to meet our needs in a week. God forbid we missed something and the upstairs neighbour is a kebab shop and late-night licensed bar, or that they're relaunching the Concorde on a flight path over the garden, or the Lizzie Line's new station entrance is through our bathroom.",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/9uj0pd/observations_on_flat_hunting_in_london/,low-traffic zones,

My first place was definitely in the ""starter home"" bracket, ie shitty little flats and new builds in industrial estates. I saw maybe 100 different properties, all sorts of weird tiny little flats overlooking major rail lines being sold on the basis of their ""panoramic views"" but for the most part I saw so many and struggled to make a decision as most places in that price range were built by the same 3 or 4 developers to the same basic template, so hard to differentiate.

My second place my budget was significantly higher, as I was selling the flat with a considerable amount of equity, at a tidy profit. This is where the weird really set in. I saw dilapidated shit piles being sold for insane amounts of money, pokey little council houses that stank, one memorable penthouse flat whose tenants literally lived like animals in the absolutely filthiest mess I have ever seen (as in, rotten apple core on the bedside table, amidst all the other rubbish), houses where there was a sewage leak in the back garden, I could go on forever.

post,Stratford (High Street and East Village): is it noisy at night?,2020-07-08 11:22:27,"Hi everyone,

I'm moving to London in one or two months, and am researching areas on where to live there. The one that sparked the most interest from me was Stratford, specifically the High Street (west from the Three Mills Wall River Weir) and East Village zones.

Apartments seem nice and affordable, good public transport accesses, and big parks surrounding it.

My main concern is the *noise*. I've seen there are train tracks everywhere and, in High Street specifically, it seems to be a main road that might have quite a bit of traffic and ambulances running around. Adding to this, I've seen that some London City flights paths might come close to the area. However, the apartments there seem new and sound isolation might help this quite a bit?

It is really important for me to get a place that is not noisy at night, in order to get a good night's sleep, so this is an important factor.

Any input and opinions would be highly appreciated, thank you :)",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/hndwzb/stratford_high_street_and_east_village_is_it/,low-traffic zones,
comment,,2020-07-08 12:04:09,"The new flats on the high street are quiet and well insulated. This is great in the winter as you'll be nice and warm but poses two problems in the summer (even with this year's feeble attempt at summer).

1. The flats quickly heat up to an uncomfortable temperature.

2. When you open the windows it is very very noise unless you are 7 or 8 floors up. There's a lot of traffic from emergency vehicles getting through East London. Also the high street is wide and straight, a favourite for racers. Maybe once every couple months someone will wrap their Audi around a traffic sign.






East village, by the trains is similar to the high street but there is constant low level noise. When commuter trains stop, you'll still have engineering works and goods trains.

East village, around the park is very quiet, you'll get the odd ambulance but that's about it. Emergent service vehicles won't drive through East village unless there is an incident in East village. It's faster for them to go around.



East village on the edge of Elizabeth park is  better than the high street if you can afford it. It is quieter, local shops and closer to the main train /tube/bus connections. You have the park, not too far from Victoria park and a canal to walk along. It has a faux sanatised community feel about it and overall doesn't have any edginess.

post,I missed the congestion zone charge payment deadline and didn't know...,2018-11-15 01:53:41,"I rented a car and went through a congestion zone unknowingly. However, by chance, I read about it and realized that I had been through the zone at one point. I went online to see how I could pay for it. Now, it didn't actually find my license plate for some reason but I attempted to pay for it anyway. And... I can't! I apparently missed it by a few minutes (it was 12:15 AM at the time). Now I'm hyperventilating and I just don't know what the hell to do. This is only going to be bad...

1. I rented the car. That means there's going to be ""admin fees"" from the rental car company.
2. I may end up getting a charge notice and pay some crazy amount of money.

I can't afford all of this. Do I call the rental company and let them know upfront and try to work it out with them to keep the cost low? Do I call the London Traffic Enforcement office? I don't know what to do.

Now I will say this, I'm an American. I am thinking of just not paying for it. I don't plan on returning anytime soon.

Any thoughts on this?",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/r/london/comments/9x65fk/i_missed_the_congestion_zone_charge_payment/,low-traffic zones,

Some will automatically pay the PCN and invoice you for the cost + admin fee.

Ok

Why not look on the website you were trying to pay on?
