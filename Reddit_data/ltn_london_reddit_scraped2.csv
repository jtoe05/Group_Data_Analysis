comment,,2020-09-12 16:37:51,"Agreed. It might be poorly executed and ill thought out but no amount of public consultation will change the fact that this is something that needs to happen. The idea isn't to make a small number of arterial roads jam packed with cars - the idea is to make a small number of arterial roads so jam packed with cars that people wake up and go 'fuck this, I'm not using my car'. Every protester I saw today was talking about care workers and disabled access, as though this is the critical argument that must be considered in combatting climate change...

comment,,2020-09-12 18:18:18,"It bothers me when people who couldn’t give less of a shit about disabled people use us as a reason to oppose sensible changes. I’m a wheelchair user and while I can’t speak for all disabled people (as many do need to use a car to get from a-b for a large variety of reasons), life is better for me when public transport is abundant and efficient. For a lot of people who can’t use public transport, it’s because it’s not accessible. If I need a car to get between home and wherever I’m going it’s cos there’s no lift at the station or the buses won’t put the ramp out. So it’s a straw man argument to suggest that low traffic neighbourhoods are discriminatory against vulnerable people, because jam packed roads make it really hard for disabled people to get around too. 

If they cared that much they’d be campaigning for a better welfare state or improved access or literally ANYTHING more relevant to our lives.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/ird6cy/march_in_northfields_to_protest_the_setup_of_new/g4xyfhh/,,March in Northfields to protest the setup of new LTN (Low Traffic Neighbourhood) without public consultation,No

comment,,2020-10-22 16:39:20,"Well I had a look at some recent studies and they don't support the claim that LTN's decrease overall traffic use on surrounding roads, mainly because they didn't study it (??? very strange, is that because it might make the scheme look bad? I hope not but suspicious imo).

There's evidence that people self report cycling and walking more, but it doesn't seem to be massively statistically pronounced.

I may have sounded like I am against any and all traffic reduction schemes, but this is not the case. I do think it's a good idea, but I think if you're going to direct all traffic down a main road away from rat runs then you should also consider adding an extra lane to that road or other upgrades.

I don't think simply increasing journey times is a very good strategy, I think it should be attacked the other way by making it easier to use other forms of travel and just mainly leaving the car the fuck alone. 

Now I know London is a bit different, most of my thinking is how these kind of schemes have been implemented where I live, they have closed several key bridges to prevent 'rat runs' and it has made the traffic worse on the main roads, no doubt about it.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/jfvcru/despite_a_loud_opposing_minority_lowtraffic/g9ng6ul/,,"Despite a loud opposing minority, low-traffic neighbourhoods are increasingly popular.

post,"I've been reluctant to tell my story, but maybe now is the time.",2023-08-01 00:03:03,"I've always been reluctant to post about my experience because it's unsettling and it freaks me out to this day. With the recent whilstelblowers coming out, maybe it would be beneficial for me to share my experience, observations and evidence. Word of warning though: things get more and more 'woo' as the story unfolds.

On the 12th of January 2008, I was staying in the spare bedroom of my Dad's house in the Mossley Hill area of Liverpool, UK. I was 18 at the time, and my dad was 43. I went to sleep at about 11:00pm. Just after midnight, my dad comes into my bedroom to wake me up, and he insists that I join him in the main bedroom at the front of the house to look at something.

I was reluctant to get up, but he insisted. From the upstairs front bedroom, we then watched approximately 100-200 glowing 'orbs' silently moving over our neighbourhood for what seemed to be at least 10 minutes.

The objects looked like balls of plasma, roughly 15-30 feet in diameter. To the naked eye, the colours were primarily orange and red, however they would sometimes change colour and appear green or purple. They were moving at low altitude; 50-100 feet above the neighbouring houses. The objects appeared to move in a line formation, with very precise motion. Objects in the formation appeared to follow each other in a straight line, however the motion was staggered, meaning one object would go from being completely stationary, and then it would instantaneously transition to what I'd say was about 40mph in order to catch up with the next object in the formation. 

We stood in place for about 10 minutes, and then my dad said he was going to go downstairs and get the cameras. He told me to stay in the bedroom because he feared for my safety. I continued to watch the objects alone for a further few minutes before presumably going back into my bedroom and falling asleep. I dont have any memory of going back into my bedroom to sleep that night. It's unsettling to think that it could be missing time, however it could just be because I was groggy having been fast asleep just 15 minutes beforehand.

The next morning, I spoke to my dad about what happened with him.

He told me that he went downatsairs into the kitchen and picked up one of our two Olympus 2mp digital cameras. These cameras were usually kept inside of our waterproof dive housings, as they were the cameras that we'd take scuba diving - we've both used the cameras thousands of times at depths below 20 metres, and never had an issue with them.

He said he went into the back garden, and the objects were low enough and bright enough to illuminate the garden. One detail he mentioned, was that everything felt incredibly silent and still - there was no wind noise, insect noise, and no car or traffic noise. I cant remember his exact quote, but he said it felt like being in a 'separate bubble of reality'. 

He then tried to take photographs of the objects directly above our house, however the camera behaved in an unusual way that we've never seen before or since. The first few images registered as pure black, with essentially no pixel data. He then tried switching to video mode, however the video refused to start recording. He tried again, and eventually managed to start the recording process, however the video file would not playback - we get a 'picture error' message on the camera display when trying to play it, which indicates that the SD card was somehow corrupted. He went back to photo mode, and eventually managed to get some images that remained on the device, however even these images are quite strange;

The objects in the photographs appear 'blue shifted', meaning that they appear blue/green whereas to the naked eye they appeared red/ orange. Even more strangely, some of the objects that were occluded from view (ie, they were obscured by the house) were later found to be visible in the images. This means that light from the objects was able to pass through the solid house and register on the device and create an impression on the camera sensor. Note, these occluded objects appear much more diffuse and 'fuzzy' compared to the ones that weren't occluded.

In terms of the images, we still have the original SD cards stored safely in case they're needed for analysis - they're untouched from that night. In terms of the digital images that actually registered, unfortunately I can only share the cropped versions that my dad put together afterwards, you can find them here: https://imgur.com/gallery/KpQz26k

I recognise that these images arent the most convincing evidence for others, however I believe they're important because having some sort of sensor data at least confirms to me personally that something actually happened, and it wasnt just a shared hallucination.

In terms of follow up, things get pretty wierd and I'm not 100% if I've got the timeline correct. 

My dad contacted the local media and police to see if anybody else reported anything, which they hadn't. It's worth noting that there would've been hudreds of people leaving pubs and bars nearby at this time of night at the weekend, so the fact that nobdy else witnessed hundreds of orbs flying overhead is very strange. I'm not certain, but I think my dada also reffered the case to MUFON. 

For me personally at that time, I was undergoing flight training at Liverpool Flying School, and I was unsure if this should be reported the CAA as a flight hazard. My instructors changed each week, but my favouirite one happened to be an oldschool ex-RAF pilot with a big moustache and leather flight gloves. I dont want to Dox him, but I'm sure it'd be possible to find his details if necessary. Anyway, after my next lesson I confided in him and told him what happened. He advised me not to report it, and then he started telling me of his own experience which he'd also refused to officially report. I wont butcher his story here, but long story short, he said he was flying military jets over the lake district in th 80s when he was tasked with investigating a large radar signature that was miles wide. He ended up witnessing a gigantic 'see through' disk shaped object that flipped on it's side and shot up into space. Frightening! 

I wish this was the end of the story, but unfortunately not.

For the next 6 months we had numerous follow up sightings in the same location. I was present for two of them, but there were at least 5 other occassions according to my dad. These sightings were different to the original however - they all took place in daylight, and the objects were the typical spherical silver/white objects at very high altitude - the ones that always get dismissed as baloons.

We didnt seem to have any technicial malfunctions when taking images of these craft, however it was very difficult to get enough  zoom with the cameras to see them. Funnilly enough, we decided to purchase a big reflector telescope to go in the garden for this very purpose and that's when they stopped showing up!

In terms of these follow up sightings, on at least one occassion a neighbour confirmed that he could see it as well when it remained in place for a full 8 hours.  In terms of their behavior, these white spheres would materialse and dematerialse from nowhere. They seem to quickly shrink in size, or grow in size from nothing - very similar to this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzZLm38Dacs

One behaviour we noticed, was that these spheres would sometimes multiply in number and then move into each other without self intersecting, almost as if they could overlap each other in 3D space. In terms of motion, these objects would remain completely stationary in the wind, or move in a strangely linear manner that seemed a bit jarring.

Here's a pretty uninspring video my dad took during one of these follow up sightings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_38MgYxsQ0&amp;t=1s

As you can imagine, the experiences were starting to have quite a proufound affect on me, and I fell 'down the rabbit hole'. Things started to get very 'woo' at this point:

I essentially dropped out of sixth form and became obsessed with theoretical physics. During this time, I would still go into school to speak privately with my physics teacher, and I started to develop my own ideas about the nature of spacetime. My professor somehow organised for me to privately meet with some folks in the physics department at the Univeristy of Liverpool, which I agreed to. This was a pretty odd experience in itself, beacsue I wasn't there for an interview or university application - it seemed like these reserachers just wanted to probe my ideas and then guide me in a certain direction.

Again, I'm not going to Dox the contacts who 'interviewed' me, but here's a brief summary of their research fields:

- Fundamental symmetries foundational to physics, in particular a group structure relating the fundamental parameters space, time, mass and charge.

- A universal rewrite system derived from the concept zero.

- A nilpotent version of relativistic quantum mechanics, with significant applications in particle physics and cosmology.

- Fundamental mathematical structures relating to physics and biology

- Application of rewrite concept to analysis of large-scale systems in physics, biology, theoretical computing

So at this point, both my Dad and I are searching for answers in different places - I was more interested in the technical theories regarding spacetime, whereas my dad was more interested in the human conspiracy side of things. He asked me to join him at a UFO conference that took place in Liverpool a few months after our experiences. It's difficult to find information about this event online, but I can say that the event took place in the Static gallery on Roscoe street, and Nick Pope was there along with some of the witnesses from the Rendalsham forrest incident.

There was a short intermission during the event, and I went outisde with a few of the attendees who were having a smoke break before the next speaker. I was in full flow describing my space time theory to a stranger and they started calling us back inside - at this point I looked up and saw a small red/orange orb in the distance. At first I thought it was a lantern, however it then started to move very erraticly backwards and forwards tracing out the shape of a large sine wave in the sky - exactly what I was trying to describe to the person I was talking to. We both watched it for a minute, then I suggested we should shout into the building to let all the UFO guys come and take a look - we had all the experts in the building right next to us! I know this sounds unbelieveable, but the stranger told me ""it's a message for you"", and then he left.

At this point I'm freaking out and I go inside - almost having a panic attack. This nice hippy guy then sits me down in the lobby and shows me a breath exercise to help calm down. Later that night as we're leaving the conference, the same guy hands me a hand printed booklet on hermetic psi exercises, which I've now unfortunately lost and cannot find anywhere online. I did spend a few months attempting the exercises in the booklet however it gave me severe, terrifying sleep paralyisis and very vivid, frightening dreams. This, combined with unsettling nature of the other encounters mentioned above was enough to scare me away from the subject in general.

For the last 14 I've just lived a normal life as a 3d rendering artist - I try my best to avoid the subject of UFOs, theoretical physics, and all the 'woo' that's associated with it. I know it's real, and I know it's important, but it's also terrifying for reasons that I still cant fully explain. Hopefully the post I've written here will be enough to allow someone braver/more intelligent than myself to investigate and come up with some answers.

post,London’s low-traffic zones ‘cut deaths and injuries by more than a third’,2025-07-07 20:34:42,"Low-traffic neighbourhoods cut road injuries and deaths by more than a third within their boundaries with no apparent negative safety effect on nearby roads, a study has shown.

Based on comparisons of more than a decade of road casualty statistics between 113 London LTNs and other roads that did not have them, the report’s authors found that LTNs were associated with a 35% reduction in all injuries, rising to 37% for deaths and serious injuries.

In absolute terms, the study concluded, this meant that creating the LTNs prevented more than 600 road injuries that would have otherwise taken place, including 100 involving death or serious injury.

comment,,2025-05-11 09:38:38,"The thing that annoys me about this story is the council doubling down on the fact that they did their consultation incorrectly and wasting local people's money on court costs.


My own council in London did their consultation on parking permits on my road incorrectly. Instead of doubling down and forcing it through, they repeated the consultation so did it correctly the second time. The result was the same. It probably helped that a councillor lived off the road so knew some of the residents who wouldn't hesitate to take the council to court.


I recently had an issue with another London council. It's gone on for a few years. To cut a long story short they have now realised that I will take them to court if they don't behave appropriately and due to the change in the law will ask for reporters to be present, as a result they have now backtracked on their behaviour.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1kju9by/labour_council_acted_unlawfully_over_low_traffic/mrps9t0/,,Labour council acted unlawfully over low traffic neighbourhood,Yes

Most discussions of LTNs end up taking place on at least [the third order of simulacra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation), approaching pure simulacrum: everything is standing in for an idea of something else, with references to the object level even being considered naive. 

So I think it is a useful exercise to first simply imagine what you think happened in this case, based purely on the headline and your general vibes. Then, and this is the really tricky bit, try to put yourself in the mindset of someone from the 1950s, or an alien from the planet Zog, who has never heard of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and has no preconceived ideas about what they relate to, or who is supposed to like or dislike them, or what they are supposed to achieve.

Das sorgt dafür, dass die Behinderung schnell ""umgangen"" werden kann und belastet den Falschparker finanziell nicht in Abhändigkeit von dem Brand sondern lediglich dem Schaden an den Autos. Das ist wesentlich fairer. 

Warum nicht am Brandschaden beteiliegen?

post,My latest Low-Traffic neighbourhood,2025-09-16 23:41:42,"I just converted another area of my city into an LTN, to create a cycling and walking safe neighbourhood. I've attached some stills of the improvements. I upgraded the main road to include a segregated cycle lane.

I then placed some modal filters at some junctions (and other strategic points), to allow only cycles and pedestrians through. This should hopefully reduce traffic in this area, as it has in all my other LTNs.

I also replaced a vehicle bridge with two separate cycle and pedestrian bridges (last image)

How did I do? What other improvements can I make city-wide to help cyclists and pedestrians? How else can I improve my LTNs?

P.S. bus services are still running normally through this LTN, and are servicing the area well, without any significant delays. In fact, the reduced traffic from the LTN will hopefully \*increase\* bus timings.

post,"In light of Enes Kanter's injury, let's take a look at other stupid ways NBA players got injured.",2017-01-27 16:03:06,"**""ARE YOU EXTINGUISHING TO ME??""**

During 2012 playoffs a frustrated Amare Stoudemire, for unknown reasons, attacked a fire extinguisher minutes after the New York Knicks' Game 2 loss to the Miami Heat. The Knicks power forward suffered lacerations on his left hand which required stitches. He suffered the laceration on the inside of his palm, on the side of his hand closest to the pinkie. Subsequently, Amare has been extinguished from Game 3. It is important to note, that fire extinguisher's side of the story was never heard.

------------------------------

**BEEP, BEEP**

Shortly after inking a six-year, $66 million dollar contract extension, Monta Ellis torpedoed Golden State's 2008-09 season when he tore a ligament in his left ankle and sustained a high-ankle sprain in a ""low-speed"" moped accident. So not only did he screw his team over, he lost serious Man Points for getting injured not only on a moped...but while driving said moped at low speeds. 

---------------------------------------

**UPSETING THE GODS**

Tony Allen blew out his knee -- tearing both ACL and MCL -- while trying to throw one down after the whistle had blown. That's a direct message from the Basketball Gods, and it can be interpreted as: ""Thou shall not showboat, mortal fool!"" Oh, and he also missed the dunk.

----------------------------------------

**BIG BALLS TOO MUCH FOR THE WOLVES' TITLE HOPES**

The Minnesota Timberwolves' best chance of reaching the Finals with Kevin Garnett came in 2004, but Sam Cassell injured his hip before the start of the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers defeated the Wolves and played the Detroit Pistons in the Finals. ""All the time,"" said Flip Saunders about Cassell's injury. ""It was his hip. He made a shot out of the corner against Sacramento in Game 7 [of the conference semifinals], and he did his little Big Balls dance, and from that, he created a little avulsion fracture in his hip. No question, I think about that dance all the time. But that’s the NBA. I went to four straight conference finals in Minnesota and Detroit, and we had injury issues in each one. The team that wins the title is usually the healthiest team.""

-------------------------

**PRO BOWL**

Andrew Bynum injured his knee when going bowling, while being injured. Yes he did.

---------------------------

**NIGHT PARALYSIS**

In 2012 Kevin Love slept with his right arm extended off his bed all night and when he woke up he couldn't move it and had to miss the next game. 

------------------------

**STEVE THE SPIKE**

Lakers guard (at the time) Steve Blake suffered a puncture wound to his left foot after stepping on a spike strip in a parking lot. He was out for three weeks. Blake said he hurt himself when he ""got distracted going back to my truck"". Good job, Steve.

--------------------------

**LOTION-EYEZ KILLA**

Charles Barkley missed the Phoenix Suns' 1994-95 season opener because the first layers of his corneas got burned off by body lotion during an Eric Clapton concert. Apparently, allergies and the dazzling stage lights caused Sir Charles to rub his eyes, and he got lotion in them. Phoenix Suns team doctor, Richard Emerson, said: ""It was a chemical reaction to a type of lotion that he uses. I wouldn't anticipate it'll reoccur because I don't think he'll use that type again."" 

---------------------------------


**SLEEPIN' &amp; CHILLIN'**

Prior to the 1995-96 NBA season, BJ Tyler was selected by the Toronto Raptors in the 1995 expansion draft. According to journalist Chris Young's book Drive, Tyler accidentally fell asleep with a pack of ice on his knee, severely damaging it and thus losing all the speed for which he was famed, and subsequently had to retire.

--------------------------

**DISHES GET STICHES**
Brad Miller needed nine stitches in his right index finger after almost chopping it off with a knife while doing dishes last season...on the same day he was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career. Said Miller: ""It's the last time I help do dishes."" Said teammate Mikki Moore: ""When I saw him, it was all wrapped up. So, I said, 'You're going to drop 20 and 20 in two games and then go and cut your knuckle off?' I said, 'That's real smart, Brad.' He said, 'Nah, that's my luck.'"" 

--------------------------------------------

**""THANKS REF""**

During the 2001-02 season, Corey Maggette got so upset over a call that he slammed his hand on the scorer's table in frustration and dislocated the ring and little fingers on his right hand. Maggette ended up with a cast and a four-week vacation.


-------------------------------------

**FINALS MVP**

Ah, Darko, Darko, Darko. He was put in for what was described as a ""token"" appearance in the Pistons' Game 5 blowout of the Lakers in the 2004 NBA Finals. He played 2 minutes, finishing with 1 rebound, 1 steal, 1 turnover...and 1 broken hand. Oh yes he did. The injury required surgury and sidelines him for eight weeks. 

--------------------------

**CAN'T HANDLE THE JOE**

Derrick Coleman -- whose NBA career was limited and cut short largely due to injury problems -- got injured again, only this time it happened while filming an episode of the TV show Pros vs. Joes. DC was participating in a rebounding challenge against some ""average joe"" when he came down from a jump and landed awkwardly, hurting his always-troublesome knee. This means that Coleman probably has the dubious distinction of being the first Pro to ever get injured during battle with a Joe.

-------------------------------------------

**SLICING AND DICING**

The Bulls rookie (at the time) Derrick Rose was forced to miss some practice time because, get ready for it, he cut himself under the elbow on his left forearm. In bed. From a knife he used to slice an apple. Said Rose: ""Silly accident this morning. I went to get a bottle of water, forgot the knife was there and sat down and sliced my arm. I panicked when it first happened. I called [Bulls trainer Fred Tedeschi]. We got it stitched up about 8 [a.m.]. It was a large wound, but they healed it up. I'm good. I could have practiced, but they told me to wait until [today]. I can still dribble, shoot, do all that stuff. I'm hoping they'll let me play.""

------------------------------------

**HOW TO PUT ON A SHOE 101**

In December 2001, before a game against the Washington Wizards, DirK Nowitzki sprained a tendon in his ankle when he put his shoe on improperly and the stomped his foot on the floor to make sure it was on right. The injury was so bad he missed the game. 

---------------------------------------

**HIDDEN DANGERS OF A WALK-THROUGH**

Eddy Curry had to miss a game due to a badly sprained left ankle suffered at...a walk-through at his team's morning shoot-around. Nope. I'm not kidding. Said teammate Malik Rose: ""How do you explain something like that?"" Good question. A very good question.

----------------------------

**E-CITY VS PHYSIOBALL**
Speaking of good questions, here's another: Can a player suffer a more embarrassing injury than spraining his ankle during a walk-through? Well, the answer is ""yes"" my friends. From the New York Daily News: ""Poor Eddy Curry. He sat on the giant blue physioball during a break from Monday's practice and the ball exploded. Eddy fell and scraped and his wrist but should be okay. The ball, which is used for stretching exercises, was pronounced dead at the scene."" This also answers the classic ""How do you know when you're too fat?"" question.

-----------------------------------

**""I TRIED TO WARN HIM"" - Eddy Curry**

Francisco Garcia broke his arm...on a physioball. No, really. At least he wasn't so fat it exploded on him...

-----------------------------

**DIAL 555-INJURY**

Prior to Game 3 of the 1992 first round playoff series between the Indiana Pacers and the Boston Celtics, George McCloud ""held his ankle in a funny way"" while talking on the phone. This somehow injured the ankle so badly he couldn't play in the game and had to sit on the bench in street clothes as his team got eliminated. 

----------------------------

**AGENT ZERO'S BARBERSHOP**

File this one under ""unfortunate pube shaving accidents."" Very unfortunate. I'll let Gilbert Arenas tell the tale: ""When I was new in the NBA the team veterans convinced me to shave, you know, down there, because they said the hair stinks. I used my girlfriend's razor, which was rusty and gave me keloids. The doctor prescribed medicine to dab on, but I just poured it all over. Three days later I woke up screaming. The skin was burnt off my scrotum, down to my crack, everything -- just raw flesh. I still had to run and play, so I used a numbing spray for a month until it healed. Now I use clippers.""

-----------------------------

**OFF TO A GREAT START**

Greg Ostertag fractured the third metacarpal on his right hand in October of 2004 when he tripped on a footstool while getting out of bed. Mind you, this happened after his first day of practice with his new team, the Sacramento Kings.

--------------------------

**THE LUGGAGE CONSPIRACY**

1991 Jeff Ruland made a comeback for the Sixers. He was out of action for five years but attempted to return for the 1991-92 season. However, the comeback ended because of...a luggage cart. Yes, a luggage cart, which was (allegedly) rammed into Ruland's leg by a Celtics employee as he waited for a team bus outside Boston Garden. (It should be noted that Ruland was not a popular in Boston, and he was even nicknamed ""McNasty"" by the Celtics' late great broadcaster Johnny Most.) Ruland said: ""I got run over by a luggage cart. That's hard to swallow. It can't be accidental, they were moving too fast. Whoever could foresee anything like this happening?""

------------------------------------

**PERK'S TIC-TAC-TOE**

Boston's big man (at the time) Kendrick Perkins missed time due to a right big toe that was injured when he dropped a bed on it. ""I was asleep. I guess whoever put my bed together didn't put it together right when I moved, so one side of my bed fell. My bed was tilted, so I got out of my bed to go push down on the other side. And when I was about getting ready to push down on the other side, the headboard started coming in. So I tried to push the headboard back so it wouldn't fall over. My foot was under the bed and the other side of the bed fell on my foot."" Man, I hate it when that happens.

-------------------------------

**CRIPPLING BUZZER-BEATER**

During the mid-90s, Kevin Johnson won a regular season game on a buzzer-beating shot and received a crippling bear hug from teammate Charles Barkley. And I mean ""crippling"" in the literal sense. Chuck squeezed Kevin so hard his shoulder was dislocated. (At least Barkley didn't rub any body lotion in KJ's eyes.) He was out of action for the next two weeks. KJ also had hernia surgery in 1996 after years of abdominal problems that were allegedly brought on by picking up teammate Oliver Miller to celebrate a play.

----------------------------

**TALL PEOPLE PROBLEMS**

Kobe Bryant hurt his back. Vacuuming. But he says it's because of vacuum size discrimination. 

------------------------------

**AIR TAKES OUT BIRD**

In the fall of 1988, Larry Bird was attempting a comeback from dual achilles surgery when he permanently injured in his back. How? He was undercut by Michael Jordan, who then fell on Bird...in the Kenny Rogers Charity Basketball Tournament in Kentucky. According to his second autobiography, Bird Watching: On Playing and Coaching The Game I Love, Bird said: ""We were in the final minutes of this charity basketball game when I went up for a rebound and came down a little sideways. Michael Jordan was going for the ball too, and he landed on my back. Right away I knew I was in trouble. I had torn additional portions of the disc wall, and my back was really traumatized. I didn't know it then, all the way back in 1989, but that was the beginning of the end…I never came all the way back."" 

------------------------

**""I GOT A YACHT TO FEED""**

Latrell Sprewell, the man whose hands once said 'hello' to his coach's neck, broke his hand by taking a swing at the boyfriend of a female party guest who threw up on his yacht. But it seems that Spree's punches were roughly as accurate as his jumpers (42 percent lifetime): He whiffed and punched the wall instead. Sprewell tried to cover up the incident, but some of his guests leaked the story and the Knicks fined Spree $250,000 for not reporting the injury. Sprewell complained about it to the press. ""They talk about being a family but they're not sticking with me. The biggest thing to me is that I'm hurt. So don't kick me when I'm down."" 

--------------------------

**DNP - GAMING**

Lionel Simmons suffered an injury during the 1990-91 season: He missed two games with wrist tendonitis caused by overtraining on his Nintendo Game Boy.

Note that, a year later, Derrick McKey missed seven games with the same injury.

-------------------------- 

**AQUA LUC**

During the 1996-97 season, the Bulls lost Luc Longley's services for seven weeks after he got hurt body surfing. Yeah. Luc was body-surfing off the coast of Los Angeles coast when an unexpectedly strong wave drove him shoulder-first into the ocean floor and knocked his clavicle and shoulder out of place.

--------------------

**HIS SMOKENESS**

Although Michael Jordan  was already kinda sorta unofficially retired (again), Jordan severed a tendon in his right index finger (i.e., on his shooting hand) while using a cigar cutter in January 1999. Officially listed as a ""a laceration of the flexor tendon,"" Jordan needed surgery to repair it and six weeks of occupational therapy to rehabilitate it.

--------------------------

**HIGH MUGGSY**

Muggsy Bogues, the tiny, tiny man (who was playing for the Toronto Raptors at the time) missed the second half of a game against the Portland Trailblazers after accidentally sucking in some ointment fumes during a halftime treatment. Said Bogues: ""Never happened to me before and I hope it never happens again. That was one of those fluke things you don't even dream about.""

---------------------------

**TEAM BONDING**

This entry harkens back to 2003, during Portland's infamous ""Jail Blazer"" era. Ruben Patterson ended up with a shiny black eye thanks to a five-knuckeled ""hello"" from teammate Zach Randolph. Patterson, who earlier that season had been arrested on suspicion of domestic assault, was arguing with Qyntel Woods, who himself had been recently cited by Portland police on marijuana possession charges after a traffic stop, when Randolph stepped in and sucker-punched Patterson. While, it should be noted, Patterson was being restrained by teammates. Nice, huh? Patterson then promised not to retaliate...until his probation expired in May (it was April at the time). Good times all around. 

-------------------------

**EXTREME HOBBIES**

While playing for the Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan-less 1993-94 season, Scott Williams had a string of bizarre injuries. First, he missed four days of practice after straining his shoulder at the team's annual bowling outing. A few days later, he hurt his back lifting a TV he bought on sale. Then, later in the season, he injured a tendon behind his right kneecap while stretching, and that was the end of his season.

--------------------------

**RADMAN'S WINTER X-GAMES**

In February of 2007, Vladimir Radmanovic separated his shoulder falling on a patch of ice in Park City, Utah. Or so he claimed. But a few days later, Radmanovic admitted that he had actually hurt himself in a fall during a jump while snowboarding. Said the Radman: ""The truth is that I hurt myself in a fall while snowboarding. Being young and sometimes immature, I initially panicked and made up a false story about how I hurt myself. However, over the past few days my conscience has been bothering me terribly. I am not a dishonest person and could no longer live with this deception. Therefore, I came forward today and told the truth to the Lakers."" Mind you, his contract specifically banned him from taking part in activities that involve significant risk of injury, including skiing and snowboarding. The space cadet was fined $500,000.


------------------------------------

**LIGHTS OUT**

Carlos Boozer broke his hand after tripping over his gym because it was too dark to see at 6PM. Somebody was knocking at the door, and Boozer rushed to answer. On the way, he tripped over his big gym bag in the hall and fell. He went down awkwardly on his right hand and felt it pop. The neighbours later testified they heard an extremely loud ""AHHH AND-ONE!"" echoing through the neighbourhood.

That's the judgement. The case is, as usual, being made out to be something it isn't. This is not some ruling about the merits or not of LTNs, but about whether this specific council competently complied with the statutory consultation requirements. (They didn't.)

Of course most LTN opposition is from conspiracy nuts and right-wing loons, but UK councils are commonly incompetent, and so are quite capable of either buggering up LTNs so badly that the (unquestionable) benefits are minimised and the disadvantages maximised, or of imposing obviously-bad LTNs for local political reasons\*. This ruling has nothing to say about the merits of this particular LTN, though when a council is incompetent enough to mess up the statutory consultation, I have no confidence that they will have come up with a good LTN scheme. 

\*I am not familiar with every LTN in London, by any means, but out of the fairly limited number I've seen, most are quite well designed, and two are frankly dreadful: one has taken all the traffic from a number of wealthy roads, to the benefit of wealthy homeowners, and shoved it onto roads running past schools predominantly used by the poorer parts of the community; another seems to be pretty blatantly designed to stop poor people going to or through a rich area, with a ridiculous time-cost to the residents of the LTN due to the only entries and exits being on a very congested stretch of dual carriageway, permitting travel in only one direction, with no sensible way to go in the other direction.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1kis29q/west_dulwich_lowtraffic_neighbourhood_ltn/mrhjd5u/,,"West Dulwich low-traffic neighbourhood (LTN) unlawful, High Court rules",Yes

What I will say, specifically linked to this post, is that the likes of the West Dulwich Action Group aren’t actually looking for the nuance you are alluding to (by the way I never implied that the matter isn’t nuanced). Going through the trouble of taking an entire council to court kind of gives away your intentions. 

London remains a heavily car-centric city as a whole and this is not sustainable according to any metrics (costs, emissions, air quality, or safety). Change will inherently be awkward and will come with unintended consequences.

post,Hanover low traffic area,2022-09-02 17:42:29,"Has anyone else had the nonsense, misleading, appeal to ignorance flyer through their door suggesting that the low traffic neighbourhood is bad for the environment? 

I'm really enraged to be honest. The first attempt at one in the city, with actually really limited changes to the traffic flow, on roads that I cycle on and get forced to stop because ""Mr look how big my balls are"" in his car or van has to prove a point. (Even though council tax pays for roads). 

It's so sad that this presumably funded pro-car-flyer has been distributed to encourage people to ""stop the forced LTN"" that will supposedly ""destroy Hanover"" has been circulated and I worry that it will lead to lots of car owners leaving feedback and lots of non car users, pedestrians, cyclists... Parents... Not actually leaving positive feedback. 

A low traffic neighbourhood will be better for people with sensory disabilities, those that cycle and can commute to work or to the station via bike without the worry of for example half asleep drivers blasting their horn at you as they speed down a side street, for those with kids who want to stretch their legs without the constant flow of traffic. The entire point is that cars can still get to their location via a road that is built to sustain the volume of traffic. For example where is there traffic lights and crossings in Hanover? I have also done some simple searches and the idea that the traffic will continue to be higher of the routes around Hanover is debunked, people in low traffic neighbourhoods tend to embrace the change and abandon their car (to some extent)

Ultimately are you in favour of trying and maybe failing, or are you in favour of not trying and sticking with business as usual, all the while having unsafe streets for those who choose to cycle and pedestrians, having increased air pollution, increased noise pollution particularly at night with cars who have no business being in the side streets?

It’s totally unsurprising that people forget what signs mean.

The sign itself should be designed in a way that obviously indicates what it means. That’s why stop signs say STOP in huge readable letters. You don’t actually have to have seen a stop sign to know what I means.

post,Are London approaches (Cycle Quietway network and Low Traffic Neighborhood) feasible in NYC?,2024-11-26 19:14:33,"Learned that other than building lanes, London uses the concept of ""[Cycle Quietways](https://ecf.com/news-and-events/news/london-quietways)"" which utilize less-traffic streets, dead ends, and other features to create a network for cyclists.

I've lived in London and honestly it's a genius idea. Lots of winding, narrow streets and roads are a pain to drive through but perfect to bike on. I wonder how feasible it is to design a network in NYC?

Even more progressive is the idea of ""[Low Traffic Neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Traffic_Neighbourhood)"" where certain parts of a residential area are closed to outside traffic except public transit and emergency vehicles.

comment,,2024-11-26 21:30:10,"&gt;  radical plan

Doesn't have to be radical. It can be a slow change. 

&gt; I've lived in London and honestly it's a genius idea. Lots of winding, narrow streets and roads are a pain to drive through but perfect to bike on. I wonder how feasible it is to design a network in NYC?

You have to remember that European towns and cities are old, it's easy to turn those small roads that are not accessible to cars into paths for bikes. In the US, cities are built around the idea of cars. 

NYC is progressing well in many ways about being more bike-centric but it takes a lot of work. When the [34th Open Streets](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/34th-ave-open-street-cb3-full-board-oct2021.pdf) was first put into place, there were lots of angry car folks in a lot of the town hall meetings who opposed it. And it took volunteers to make it happen, a bunch of us put the metal barriers in place in the morning and set them aside at night before the city had a budget to hire people. 

Be active in your community. Report issues! While 99% of the time, the police precinct will close a ticket without any kind of investigation, that 1% when they take action does a lot more good than all posting on this sub complaining about it.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCbike/comments/1h0ik6u/are_london_approaches_cycle_quietway_network_and/lz4rxxy/,,Are London approaches (Cycle Quietway network and Low Traffic Neighborhood) feasible in NYC?,Yes

comment,,2024-11-27 13:49:13,"For me, one of the things that made cycling in London so easy was the lack of parking. I could ride close the curb even in heavy traffic areas. 

The feeling of a cycle quiet way already happens in some small pockets in NYC, those that have winding streets or dead ends nearby. 

An interesting example of a model that could be used to replicate this is the closed street in the 90s on the east side. I forget the specific street, but it's a crosstown lane closed to traffic for one block. With this small closure, the rest of the street is naturally quieter because it's not used for through traffic. 

This is to say that you don't need a complete open street like Berry Street in order to create calmer traffic conditions.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCbike/comments/1h0ik6u/are_london_approaches_cycle_quietway_network_and/lz8gby0/,,Are London approaches (Cycle Quietway network and Low Traffic Neighborhood) feasible in NYC?,Yes

+ On the appeal form it said I had to be the ""keeper"" of the car penalised,  it's not enough to be the driver on the penalty. What?

post,Inuit residential care centre Larga Baffin faces angry opposition from councillor Diane Deans,2022-04-27 14:17:46,"I had the extreme displeasure of attending a public information session last night on the Larga Baffin proposal on Hunt Club road.

Larga Baffin is a Inuit owned residential care centre for people travelling from Nunavut to Ottawa for emergency medical care unavailable at home, including treatment for cancer and heart disease. Nunavut only has one hospital and they have a huge nursing shortage and low capacity to deal with the medical concerns of residents, so they often fly to Ottawa for care.

Larga Baffin have spent the past 6 years searching for suitable property for a new building. They are currently located on Richmond Road but they are far from hospitals and the airport, and they have to overflow clients to nearby hotels because they don't have enough space. The new proposed location is much closer to the airport and medical facilities, and it's a designed community to support the people travelling for care, rather than an old retrofitted building like where they currently are.

I personally met with Diane Deans on this proposal a couple months, because I saw her opposition to it based on ""traffic"" and ""size"" and ""greenspace"" — the usual NIMBY red flags.

She literally told me that she was concerned it was going to be like the Salvation Army build in Vanier and she was worried that it was going to lead to Indigenous homeless people flooding her neighbourhood.

Keep in mind this is a sitting city councillor who is running for mayor... I was absolutely aghast then, and I still am.

I sat in on the public meeting last night and could not believe the anger and hostility from local residents, whipped into a fury by their city councillor.

Now, she publicly has reverted to claiming that the project is ""grossly oversized"" (the surrounding area is zoned for 6 storey and 9 storey builds — this is a 6 storey proposal) and she is concerned about a huge traffic impact (Hunt Club is a major arterial road, none of these people are bringing cars from Nunavut, and they have medical shuttles to get to and from appointments that serve the community).

Some of the comments at the public meeting were incredibly gross — people asked about the amount of crime this facility would bring, or how we could keep these people out of their local parks — but I wanted to highlight one in particular, which best summarizes the privilege and lack of self-awareness demonstrated by the NIMBY group angry about this project.

[https://twitter.com/DeanTester/status/1519139010324664322](https://twitter.com/DeanTester/status/1519139010324664322)

""I spent a lot of money on this house... WE ARE HERE FIRST!""

I cannot imagine how ignorant a person would have to be to tell a group of Inuit people to stay out of the neighbourhood because you think you were there first... but that's where we're at. Unfortunately, there were 250+ people on this Zoom call last night, and almost all of them were just this angry about the proposal.

If you're like me, you probably don't think that a small group of angry, wealthy homeowners, who only care about their property value, should be able to block a residential care home for desperate Inuit people, here's what you can do:

1. Tweet at dianedeans on Twitter or email her at [diane.deans@ottawa.ca](mailto:diane.deans@ottawa.ca) and let her know you want to see Larga Baffin get their new build as soon as possible, so the Inuit community can receive the world class medical care they deserve.
2. Send your feedback to the City of Ottawa through the DevApps portal — let them know you support this project! [https://devapps.ottawa.ca/en/applications/D01-01-21-0022/details](https://devapps.ottawa.ca/en/applications/D01-01-21-0022/details)
3. Email, call, or tag on social media the chairs of the planning committee — Scott Moffat and Glen Gower — and contact the other members as well, urging them to ignore the NIMBY campaign and approve this project: [https://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/council-committees-and-boards/committees-and-boards/planning-committee](https://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/council-committees-and-boards/committees-and-boards/planning-committee)

post,How can I make my newly adopted orange stray more comfortable exploring the rest of my house?,2025-12-21 00:26:15,"His name is Jasper. He used to be a stray that lived in my neighbourhood and was fed by many kind passersby (including me). **Once we confirmed that he didn't belong to anyone, we adopted him about a week ago. All things considered, he's adjusting really well** - he stopped hiding day 2, sleeps in his bed and lots of other places, climbs around, looks outside the window at birds, plays with his toys, eats heartily, and loves loves loves affection. He purs and kneads whenever I pet him and  even climbed into my lap. The one night he slept in my room he literally slept ON TOP of me the whole night - on my shoulder when I was side sleeping, on my back when I was stomach sleeping lol. I barely got any sleep, but I'm crazy about him. And I think he's crazy about me too. 

**The only problem? He doesn't seem too interested in leaving 'his room'.**

When we adopted him we decided to go by conventional advice and **gave him his own quiet space to decompress** that's low traffic and less noisy. His home base is in the study - it has his food, litter box, toys, scratching post, bed, everything. **We live in a bungalow and it's on the opposite side of the house as the bedrooms.**

It's worked wonders and **he seems really comfortable there, but he doesn't seem all that interested in exploring past it.** He pokes his head out once in a while, and he's walked around the living room. And like I said, he made it all the way to my room. But **there's too many sounds and wide open spaces**, and the hypervigilance he had when we first got him comes up again. He'll stay there if we coax him but clearly isn't all that comfortable, and prefers we follow him back to 'his room'. 

**It's only been a little more than a week. Do you think he's still adjusting and will eventually feel more confident with time? Or is there something I should be doing that i'm not?** 

He loves affection and being around people, and I love to be with him too. But **I spend a lot of time in my room (I have health issues), and would much prefer if I could give him all the affection he wants while also being in a space that's more comfortable for me. I physically can't be in the study all that long**, so he has to be alone more than he likes.

comment,,2021-10-05 09:31:00,"Funny you bring that up as that's what I was going to mention because Gent is my home town. 

For the most part, it does actually work. Before it was introduced the usual suspects bemoaned it would ""the death of independent businesses"" (which didn't happen ofcourse). 

That said, where Gent's version falls apart a bit is that despite this having been introduced, there has been basically zero investment in further public transport infrastructure. Also, since more traffic now goes over major trunk roads like the R40 (the ring road around the centre) and N430, the traffic lights are poorly timed so you end up driving from one red light to another very often which in turn, creates traffic jams during rush hour.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/q14zzi/birmingham_to_become_a_supersized_lowtraffic/hfgdp6q/,,Birmingham to become a super-sized low-traffic neighbourhood,Yes
comment,,2021-10-05 11:44:48,"&gt;How come? Did the local politicians change or something?

Because of the complicated way Belgium works, public transit and investment in it is managed on the regional (ie: Flanders) level. So basically the city council can lobby the Flemish government as much as they like but if they don't do anything at all, nothing will happen. Flanders currently has a centre-right government which has made several budget cuts in that area so yeah. Meanwhile the local city council is made up of largely leftwing and centre parties so there's some petty squabbling going on in that sense too. Gent has also historyically always been a left-leaning city (think like red wall for Labour kind of thing).",,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/q14zzi/birmingham_to_become_a_supersized_lowtraffic/hfglv2y/,,Birmingham to become a super-sized low-traffic neighbourhood,No

Courts are reticent to overturn the clear will of the legislature (which constitutionally is the expression of the will of the people) but sometimes the legislature have competing interests. People elect governments who pass laws on things like your right to not have your health harmed, how is a court supposed to know which is more important to a voter? They can’t, so they will make a straight legal judgment on whether the decision is compatible with the law. That’s why courts can and do strike down legislation even if you can argue there is strong democratic support (small boats is a recent example, deportation activity,etc) 

Beside that - when you make a decision you have a load of basic public law requirements - did you consult? Have you analysed the impact? Was the decision fundamentally rational? Etc.

post,Vent: Townhouse suburbs suck,2025-08-23 01:28:22,"I live in a townhouse, and absolutely hate it. I didn't think it would be this bad when moving in, especially considering we picked one specifically without an HOA. I was wrong.

It's so overstimulating. Every single day at least one of my 300 neighbours is getting something done to their home. Someone is always mowing a lawn, cutting down the one tree in their front yard, or getting their roof worked on. How are there construction crew trucks here every single day?? For the low low price of $500k (250 in 2021 when purchased), you too can live in a home where you don't get a single moment of peace. There's a loud car alarm going off every single day, kids are outside screaming 24/7, loud truck engines with no muffler at 5 in the morning. To top it all off, expect to never find a spot to park in front of your own if there's a holiday. 

I had to park my car almost half a block from my house on Mother's day. Honestly maybe I'd understand if it was an apartment complex you're renting at, but when you're paying $500k + property taxes + maintenance + bills I would at least like a parking spot. The streets are so narrow so when you're K-turning from the curb you can expect to be in an almost head on collision with another car going straight down that comes out of nowhere, driving the neighbourhood street at 35mph. Usually a 10 foot tall pickup truck because you really need all that in the New Jersey suburbs as a dentist!!


You get all the downside of living in a city, but none of the benefits. Sure there's a lot of places to spend money. But what difference does it make if you're somewhere rural with one nearby diner/coffee shop, versus 20 Dunkins in the suburbs? There aren't many authentic family businesses, just 15 locations of a Target and Dollar tree. It's crowded AF but nothing is made walkable. You have to take your car everywhere, and if your drive is 2 miles expect it to be at least 20 minutes of you just sitting there in stand still traffic from all the car accidents. I'm done.

post,How do you feel about Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in your borough?,2020-09-09 11:47:44,"So LTN's are popping up around London. 

The point is that they are supposed to reduce the dominance of cars in residential areas and allow journeys to be more easily made via cycling, walking and public transport. There are many places in London where they have existed for decades but it's argued that GPS, increasing numbers of cars, increasing numbers of cyclists and the need for physical distancing has made it more urgent.

However as a result some car journeys may be longer and there are claims that traffic and pollution is made worse on main roads - where people also live.

There is also large scale opposition from many black taxi drivers who are accustomed to using back streets to avoid traffic which may no longer be possible.

What's your view and it would be good to know how you travel around London?

post,Moved to Canberra - impressions,2025-10-27 05:08:55,"Hi, I just moved to Canberra four weeks ago. This subreddit helped me a lot during the planning stage, reading everyone's thoughts on this, that an' the other, so to honour that, I thought I would give back as some sort of community service and share my impressions.

For context, I am in my early forties, WFH/remote (non-APS), single, no kids, moved from Perth where I lived for 20 years.

TL;DR - Canberra is OK. It's fine. It's not as good as some made it out to be, not as bad as some people feared. It's just... fine.

Why Canberra? I knew I wanted to move east, just for a change of pace post-COVID, and had finally convinced myself after about a year of to-and-fro. Don't get me wrong, I love Perth, and it's laid back way of life, which you only get from a small place that grew up too big too fast. I knew that Sydney was too chaotic, and Melbourne was no better, so like Federal politicians in the 1900's, I compromised between the two and chose Canberra. I had never visited beforehand, and learned about the place from this subreddit and the (criminally) few videos on YouTube.

Since being here, I would like to share some impressions of the place that may help others decide whether this is the place for them (please treat me kindly):

1. Canberra seems boring if you compare it to Sydney or Melbourne. Those places are 24-Hour-Party-People cities for those with more money than sense. Comparatively speaking, Canberra is a small hamlet in the mountains. Of course it's going to be boring to those fueled on coffee, box wine, and HSPs.

2. For a city of near 400K, I don't know where all the people are. Are they out on the cycleways? Nope, not there. Are they at the malls? There should be more people around, surely. Are they walking and shopping out in their neighbourhoods? Probably, but I haven't seen them. This place seems empty, except for the tourists walking across the Commonwealth bridge. I live in the Molongo Valley, and surrounded by apartments - not a peep from the neighbours... I only know people live here because I see them driving their cars. I went to IKEA out in Majura Park on a Saturday expecting lots of people, and I swear that there were more employees than customers. It looked like a closing down sale in a dilapilated suburban mall.

3. There are three types of houses in Canberra, by my reckoning: (1) Houses made in the 50s or 60s by some quirky aspiring architect, that look cold and brown. (2) Executive townhouses made especially for those APS5 and higher. (3) Tiny apartments that they built yesterday with ""bedrooms"" that can barely fit a queen size bed - maybe the cold stunts growth.

4. The weather. People talk about how cold it is in Canberra, and yes it can get cold. But no-one talks about the wind. It is windy. VERY WINDY. I am still waiting for a hot day, being from Perth that is a given, but it did get to 29 degrees last week and the BOM said ""feels like 22"" which would agree. Ask me in six months whether I want to go back to 40 degree summers in a dry heat, I might be inclined if it doesn't warm up in summer. The weather can change on a dime here, though - watch out for that.

5. I am convinced traffic doesn't exist here, and people eerily keep to the speed limit here. Why is the Tuggeranong Parkway at only 80km/h most of the time? I'm sure visitors and city dwellers who visit Canberra will think all the complaints that your commute to Civic took 20 minutes instead of 9 are quaint. Spend a Sunday morning bumper-to-bumper northbound on the Kwinana Freeway at Berrigan Drive and come back to talk to me about Canberra's traffic problems. Non-Canberrans need to get over this obsession with pointing out the number of roundabouts - for the size of the place, there are a lot. Go to any new subdivision on any city fringe and you will find just as many.

6. Infrastructure is weird here. Some areas feel like they have not had some love in a while (like Tuggeranong or Weston Creek), and some places feel... overengineered (like Molonglo Valley). Why do you have on-road cycle lanes and shared paths right beside each other? What are those weird ramps for bicycles near roundabouts? Why are your verges so wide? Want to make a lot of money in Canberra? Be a signwriter - there are too many signs that are a duplicate of another sign littered everywhere, yet the street name signs are too small to read. Get it together.

7. Someone needs to attend to your bus system urgently. The R-number buses are great, but 15 minute frequencies are too low for a rapid system. 30-minute headways for suburban routes are too slow, and they take odd out-of-the-way routes. 5-minute peak service for the Light Rail is also too slow. Bus stops in some areas are too close or too far apart to be useful. For a place with bad winters, the shelters are insufficient - but they do look cool.

8. The nature: gorgeous. I can see what they mean by 'bush capital'. I like all the trees, the rivers (even though I think there is only two that you seem to cross a million times), and all the walks around water catchment ponds that look like mini-lakes. I hope the guy/gal/other who is paid to erect the ""Warning - Swooping Birds"" signs are paid per sign. I love all the mountains. Coming from WA which is hundreds of miles of flat (no, the Darling Scarp doesn't count), all the high hills are great. My favourite: Black Mountain.

9. The layout. Sure, Central Canberra is laid out all pretty and ""planned"", makes sense (with some exceptions near Anzac Ave). The rest of the place? Utter chaos. To me, Canberra is not one combined city, but seven small cities/towns very close to one another - they just appear out of nowhere. North and South Canberra are the goody-too-shoes eldest kids that always do what Mum and Dad says, very proper and well dressed. Tuggeranong is the edgy brother who is into ska or grunge music. Woden is the wannabe influencer sister who is now getting paid well at their marketing job. Weston Creek is dripping middle child vibes. Belconnen is the sibling who went to TAFE to become a plumber and is now working too much and saving up to buy their own van. Gungahlin is the younger child who was the first to get all new things instead of hand-me-downs. Molonglo Valley is still a baby, who knows what they will end up like - spoilt most likely.

To sum up, Canberra is an all-right kind of city. It's quiet, laid back, rugged up, insular, with expectations to do more because it is the capital city.... but doesn't really want to. I'm sure they look at Goulbourn or Queanbeyan with slight envy, sighing ""I remember when life used to be that simple"". In saying all that, I'm starting to like it here, and I don't know how I feel about that.

Thank you for your indulgence.",141.0,https://www.reddit.com/search.json/r/canberra/comments/1oh4ync/moved_to_canberra_impressions/,low traffic neighbourhood,,No

post,Nottingham tram extension proposal:,2025-07-15 12:55:38,"In 2004, after deciding it was the best way to curb traffic in the city, Nottingham reintroduced its trams. Currently the system has 2 lines and stretches into nearby towns like Beeston, which I think is its best asset. The main problem is it’s mainly along the west of Nottingham despite east Nottingham being slightly bigger.

To counteract this, I would increase the network by 4 lines, all focusing on neighbourhoods in Nottingham itself such as Arnold, West Bridgeford and Carlton. The only town outside of Nottingham served by these lines would be Ilkeston due to being located directly west.



As for the existing green lines, I would extend 3 of them to more nearby towns despite them all having train stations, since each of these towns have populations between 50,000 - 100,000 and are all part of Nottingham’s urban area but quite low rail service. These extensions would be:

Phoenix park to Heanor

Toton to Long Eaton

And finally, a complete takeover of trams on the line to Hucknall and on to Mansfield so that it can be double track the whole way. This also would allow more of Mansfield to be served by rail transit along with Kirkby and Sutton. An existing line via Pinxton can be used for mainline train services to Mansfield.

These far out tram lines would allow a massive increase in rail service in the region without having to open more train stations. Nottingham station is quite small and its surface level can’t be expanded so increasing train services can only really be done if a tunnel is dug under the city, another project I would like to see.



One extension that despite being proposed, I wouldn’t do is to Derby. I think the town should have its own tram network and the rail corridor between the two cities should be improved. I’m aware it’s nearer to Nottingham than Mansfield but it’s almost 3 times the size. Mansfield only needs 1 tram line and part of the current line to Mansfield has a parallel tram so far so just extend it the full way. The tram extension to Derby would have to be built from scratch along the A52 near towns on the railway which could just have their stations reopened.",157.0,https://www.reddit.com/search.json/r/nottingham/comments/1m0eo0p/nottingham_tram_extension_proposal/,low traffic neighbourhood,,No

A couple of weeks ago I posted that a Labour MP was using language against her local LTN in line with what Nigel Farage and others had been using ([https://www.reddit.com/r/LabourUK/comments/jzel58/labour\_mp\_siding\_with\_conservatives\_against/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LabourUK/comments/jzel58/labour_mp_siding_with_conservatives_against/)) and warned that all it would do would embolden. Since then I've seen Labour councillors and other Labour leaning people use the same kind of rhetoric. We have stoked the fire and are going to get our fingers burnt. Again.

Farage (and those like him) have been quick to jump on this bandwagon. Just like other parts of the 'culture wars' LTNs are wedge issues that can be used to emotionally garner support. Falling into line with their rhetoric will not give transfer the support to us - all it does is strengthen the support in the other direction. We should be bold in fighting back on these points, not just meekly repeating their stock phrases.

comment,,2020-12-08 11:27:19,"Cyclists are sadly an easy target, even though the vast majority do nothing wrong. I've yet to speak to someone who talks about how cyclists believe they are above the law and is able to say that they have never broken the speed limit, let alone ran ambers, parked illegally etc. Can't go out in my car without seeing multiple cases of dangerous driving or parking, yet there's no outrage there.

Unfortunately, it is borne out in our justice system too. If you're going to kill someone, you're better off doing so with a car. Even better if your victim is on a bike. Some of the sentences are stupidly lenient and yet the public still show sympathy towards the driver. Was some talk about increasing the punishment for causing death by dangerous driving, but I'm not sure that will achieve much when the CPS so regularly accept a guilty plea for death by careless driving, even in cases which are close to being a slam dunk.

[Just look at this case.](https://road.cc/content/news/driver-who-ran-over-cyclist-purpose-jailed-12-months-279287) Deliberately drive into a cyclists with what is basically a particularly deadly weapon, break both his legs and punch him while down and you'll only get 12 months, possibly out in 6...

post,"Trip report: Santiago, Chile 🇨🇱 - unfortunately, a no. ",2024-11-24 23:12:07,"I just spent two weeks working from Santiago, Chile, and as a base for remote work, it didn’t deliver enough for me to give it a compelling recommendation.

For context, I’m currently on a three-month stint working through various South American cities, starting with a month in [Bogotá](https://www.holdall.work/destinations/bogota), a week in [Medellín](https://www.holdall.work/destinations/medellin), and then two weeks in [Lima](https://www.holdall.work/destinations/lima).

***I don’t want to write it off entirely as a city, but when considering all the places on the continent—or even the world—where you could spend an extended period working, I’d rank it fairly low on the list.***



# 👎 Negatives

* **One of the most disappointing cities for food I can recall visiting.** Finding a tasty, quick, and inexpensive meal in Santiago was laborious. Chile is not a country renowned for its food, and both Peruvian and Chinese restaurants far outweighed any domestically focused outlets. Whilst the Peruvian places felt of similar quality to what you might find in Lima (if not twice the price), the Chinese restaurants were sorely lacking. There are, of course, great quality higher-end options for both local and international cuisine. But as I reflect on the two weeks, I can't recall having spent so long in a destination and failing to make any sort of connection with the food. Local staples like empanadas appeared anaemic and undercooked, while pastries and other baked goods were generally of low quality by international standards. Street food is practically non-existent, aside from a few men hauling charred meat of unknown origin on makeshift BBQs and offering some rather unappealing sandwiches.
* **The metro makes for an unpleasant morning commute.** At the risk of sounding over-dramatic, I can't recall a metro system where I ever felt so confident I could catch an illness from just momentarily setting foot in a carriage. Even at an early hour, the trains are frequently close to full capacity. Most journeys see passengers continuously jostling for space, accompanied by a soundtrack of ill-sounding coughs and music blasting from phones. Your morning commute would be best planned by avoiding it if at all possible. **‍**
* **The cities layout failed to inspire.** Structurally, I found the layout of the city underwhelming. Assuming you'll avoid the historical centre, many activity hubs are located next to arterial roads rather than being hubs in themselves. The metro has good coverage but fails to extend deep into both Vitacura and Las Condes which can make accessing parts of these more troublesome than you would expect.
* **Many items felt like bad value for money.** Whilst higher costs are to be expected in Chile, some items felt disproportionately high. In Starbucks a double espresso can cost 4,800 pesos (nearly £4). A simple meal in an unassuming, rustic, humble restaurant in the historical centre can cost up to 13,000 pesos (£10). Whilst these may not seem extreme in isolation, considering the median income in the country is dramatically lower than the say UK, it doesn't quite add up. If you are planning on eating out for most meals, it adds up over a sustained period.
* **Extortionate ATM fees.** I couldn't find anywhere which would charge less than £9 to withdraw cash from an ATM, so went the duration of the trip without doing so. Having said that, given the near-universal acceptance of card payments and few items of interest available from the street, you can easily go without. Scotiabank ATMs are reportedly fee-free but I failed to find a functioning outlet on the ground. 

# 👍 Positives

* **The Andes provide a spectacular backdrop to the city.** The mountain peaks are often masked by a heavy haze of smog and mist throughout the day, but their sporadic appearance makes for a captivating view which looks as impressive as the photos.**‍**
* **Incredibly convenient access to hiking.** Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons to visit Santiago is to immerse yourself in some of the spectacular nature that can be found on its doorstep. From an hour-long hike up Cerro San Cristóbal to potential multi-day expeditions into the Andes, you don't have to plan too hard to find some great routes.
* **A strong wine culture.** Wine fans will be in for a treat, with great-quality domestic wine freely available in bars and restaurants across the city. Expect to pay around 5,000 pesos for a glass (£4) in a nice establishment, with bottles costing less from a supermarket. Look out for some rarer locally grown varieties such as Carménère and Carignan making an appearance on menus.
* **Some of the best infrastructure in the region.** The city's expansive metro lines make it easy to navigate what can be a large urban expanse, with trains running up to every two minutes during peak hours. These are complemented by a series of concealed subterranean tunnels which carry a lot of the city's road traffic, making east-west travel easier than it would otherwise be.
* **Ideal weather.** The weather was close to perfect throughout the duration of my stay in November, a typically dry period with warm days and characteristically clear blue skies, giving way to cool night-time breezes.
* **High levels of safety by Latin American standards.** Whilst my two-week experience can't serve as a universal truth, Santiago felt significantly safer than both Medellín and Bogotá. Although there are areas you would want to avoid in the city, you can roam the neighbourhoods of Providencia, Las Condes, and Vitacura with a level of freedom similar to that in [Europe.Like](http://Europe.Like) in any major city, keep an eye on your phone and follow standard safety protocols.

[Arguably the best thing about Santiago is how easy it is to access great hiking trails. Within a 20-minute Uber ride, you can be at the start of a variety of trails with something suitable for all abilities. The landscape is a mix of mountains and semi-arid deserts, with cacti vastly outnumbering any trees. A huge benefit to have on your doorstep.](https://preview.redd.it/d66ylr8r9x2e1.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9aea26404e5df72b0806ec37d39f339cb58a458)

[Whilst the metro is undoubtedly a huge asset to Santiago, it is prone to severe overcrowding during peak hours. If you are attempting to board a Línea 1 train between 07:00 and 09:00, you can easily watch seven trains pass with only sufficient space for a single passenger to board or disembark each time. It is easily the most uncomfortable commute I've experienced.](https://preview.redd.it/40pecj6t9x2e1.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dce7cf7a1de72ef4409eaf49f94d4f7d72aa98df)



# 📋 Tips

* **Pick up a Bip! card to use public transport across the city.** The cards can be bought and reloaded at any metro station. I had issues using Apple Pay to purchase the card, so I suggest bringing a physical card to use in the station terminals when initially purchasing or topping up. Not all stationas appear to have machines which dispensed cards but I had success at the [Plaza de Armas L3 station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YccyeSDasRMSD9Qt9).
* **An Airalo eSIM was good value.** A 20GB data and voice plan cost $23 USD which, whilst more expensive than local offerings, saved time navigating the seemingly enormous queues in Movistar outlets.
* **Ubers are available from the second floor in the airport.** They don't appear to be able to pick up from the airport, but I had no problems getting one from the arrivals area, with a journey to the downtown area costing 16,000 CLP (£13). You may see out-of-date information online that the service is illegal in the country; however, in recent years it has become fully legalised and works flawlessly.
* **Bring some warm clothes for the evenings even in summer.** Even on days when the temperatures reach up to 30°C, it can drop dramatically during the evenings and early mornings.
* **Sundays are a great time to explore the city by bike or on foot.** Like other South American cities, large portions of the city's roads are closed for the Ciclovía. The area around the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes is particularly popular with people making the most of the freedom.**‍**
* **Tipping felt less transparent.** Chile shares a similar tipping culture to Colombia via the addition of a voluntary propina (10%). However, while in Bogotá there was an explicit ask of it on each transaction, in Santiago there were occasions where an effort was made to conceal the request. I couldn't quite work out if this was a general cultural trend or perhaps an attempt to take advantage of a foreigner's naivety, but there was a noticeably different dynamic.



[A view from the 22nd floor of the WeWork on Av. Apoquindo looking across Las Condes towards the Andes. Even in mid-November, there's still snow covering the peaks of the mountains in the distance.](https://preview.redd.it/ms09es61ax2e1.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=152e367a57bc79fcaf20377a2d060b3bb0d6af93)

[Over the weekends, the absence of the working population means large portions of the historical centre take on a somewhat post-apocalyptic, desolate feel, with mounds of rubbish frequently lining the streets. Whilst it never felt unsafe, your weekends are best spent elsewhere..](https://preview.redd.it/jbmw0fo2ax2e1.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e3a9f05fa01f426de1bb46d5f0df70886a505fe)





# 🖥️ Where to work

There are a reasonable number of coworking options across Santiago, with most of the quality options concentrated close to the [Tobalaba](https://maps.app.goo.gl/piPPJLCgxgvkHuJ47) station in Providencia.

**WeWork** has only one remaining site in the city, immediately outside [Manquehue metro station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jQhWsoL5sr9pU88a9), which makes it a fair distance from the city centre and a commute you'd be best avoiding.

The main All Access space is on the 22nd floor where there is a large quiet area for focused work, several phone booths, and two large outdoor patios with soft furnishings under the shade. Being so high gives you incredible views with the Andes peering into the distance further East and the core of the city further down to the West.

The main reason I would suggest ***not*** working from there is a catastrophically bad offering of food and drink in the immediate area. Whilst there is a cafe on the 22nd floor, it serves an unappealing range of microwaveable burgers, small cakes and Starbucks coffee. There are some more offerings further back towards the commercial buildings near Rosario Norte, but they are too far to be frequently walked during the working day.

If you're only passing through Santiago for a few nights and don't want to sign up to anywhere, you may want to consider using the [Santander 'Work Cafés'.](https://www.santander.com/es/stories/work-cafe-el-innovador-concepto-de-oficina-bancaria-del-santander#:~:text=A%20simple%20vista%20puede%20parecer,empresas%20de%20una%20manera%20diferente.) These bank branches have dedicated coworking spaces installed and offer facilities comparable to dedicated commercial venues. I visited several throughout the city and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the interiors. I'd suggest trying one outside the Centro Histórico, where you can expect to find a more professional and less 'ambient' working environment. They are generally open from 09:00 - 17:00, closing earlier on Fridays.

Speciality coffee shops aren't as abundant in Santiago as you may find elsewhere - Starbucks have a heavy presence across the city and can make for a viable short term option with most open until 20:00.

* **I walked extensively around much of Santiago and found little cause for concern.** Compared to my previous South American destinations, Santiago proved comfortably the easiest city for exploring on foot. With late sunsets (20:00 in November), you have plenty of daylight hours for exploration.
* **The Centro Histórico, while rough in patches, feels surprisingly secure.** During weekdays, the large working population keeps the area bustling until late into the evening. Weekends bring quieter streets which feel more eerie than threatening. I'd avoid walking through Mercado Central and the surrounding streets after dusk, as it took a notably seedier feeling in the late evenings. The lower half of the area closer to the Estacion Universidad de Chile station is in general a lot better. It's a much more viable option than either of the La Candelaria areas in Medellín or Bogotá.
* **Bellavista has a reputation for night time safety issues.** If visiting for nightlife, use Uber for travel to and from the area. There didn't feel anything to be concerned about during the daytime.
* **The Metro runs efficiently and securely.** The seemingly never ending flow of passengers on main lines and security guards on the platforms means there's always a healthy presence of people across the system.
* **Cerro San Cristóbal is super popular on weekends.** Join the crowds of locals walking up if you are hesitant about going up their alone. Again, a much safer option than the equivalent city hikes in Colombia.
* **Caution should be taken if visiting Valparaíso.** The coastal city is a popular day trip from Santiago but in recent years has had a reputation for being less secure with several dangerous areas. I didn't make it on this occasion but the security situation sounded worse than what you may find in the centre of Santiago.





# 🥾 Hikes to recommend

[**Cerro Manquehue**](https://www.strava.com/activities/12957910167/overview?utm_medium=web_embed&amp;utm_source=activity_embed&amp;strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Factivities%2F12957910167&amp;_branch_match_id=1227197644571631378&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3WOvQ6CMBSFn6aMIlRBTIgxGiZX56YtF2mgFG8LxMVntwhxM7nLuV%2FOT%2B1cb49haB3ykW94329a1TWhvCl%2B5wdqn%2BJE4l3F21Zw2bAB27yePYSeSVz4W53SaC%2B4dGpUToH1IoqzfZpF2yhJvTIj4KhgIrQYnGYaSjVoQq8TCAZaQEniZAbWDCjBgzXrtdBg6WElQD8v%2FC5Zfr8p%2F9qDN0IFiKp7MIFmsoD5pUaj4QPyKopv%2FwAAAA%3D%3D)

Take an Uber to the trailhead on Vía Roja, where you can take a path leading you up to Manquehue or the shorter Manquehuito slightly to the east. It's a steep climb to the summit along a path with numerous loose stones, offering panoramic views across the city below. Instead of returning to the trailhead, you can traverse over the top to finish in Los Trapenses, though this involves a considerable return journey to the city. No entrance ticket required.

[**Parque Natural Aguas de Ramón**](https://www.strava.com/activities/12915118674/overview?utm_medium=web_embed&amp;utm_source=activity_embed&amp;strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Factivities%2F12915118674&amp;_branch_match_id=1227197644571631378&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3WOyw6CMBBFv6YsITxENCHGaFi5dd20ZZCGluK0QNz47RYh7kxmc%2BfkPlrnBnuMIuuQTSxkwxAq2XeRuEl2Z0Vqn%2FxEkqxhSnEmOjqiKtvFQ9IzSSp%2Fm1MY7QUTTk7SSbBexMkh3sVxke8zr8wEOEmYSVqNTlMNtRw1Sa8zcAqaQ02SfAHWjCjAgy3rtdJg7aE1wLAs%2FC5Zf78p%2F9qDN0IDiLJ%2FUI5mtoDlpUWj4QOzPXVz%2FwAAAA%3D%3D)

It's worth taking an Uber to the entrance of this natural park, around a 30-minute drive from the Centro Histórico. There are a variety of well-marked trails traversing a stream running through the foothills of the Andes, with the trail concluding at some waterfalls. Plan for 5 hours up and down. Book a ticket in advance (3,500 pesos) from the website to avoid queuing on arrival. You will be asked for your ID number but you do not need to bring the physical document with you.

[**Santa Lucia Hill &amp; Cerro San Cristobal**](https://www.strava.com/activities/12870968949/overview?utm_medium=web_embed&amp;utm_source=activity_embed&amp;strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Factivities%2F12870968949&amp;_branch_match_id=1227197644571631378&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA3WOvQ6CMBSFn6aMoEAQTIgxGiZX56YtF2loKd4WiIvPbhHiZnKXc7%2Bcn9a5wR6jyDpkEwvZMIRK9l0kbpLdWZ7YJz%2BROG2YUpyJjo6oynbxkORM4srf5hRGe8GEk5N0EqwX%2Bzg%2F7IosL9LCKzMBThJmklSj01RDLUdNkusMnILmUJM4W4A1IwrwYMt6rTRYe2gNMCwLv0vW32%2FKv%2FbgjdAAouwflKOZLWB5adFo%2BACxndcB%2FwAAAA%3D%3D)

If you're out for a day of exploring, it's worth combining these two sites. I'd suggest visiting at the weekend when you'll be joined by hundreds of others heading up San Cristóbal Hill, which is part of the Parque Metropolitano de Santiago. If you fancy a hike, you can carry on further, with plenty of walking and cycling trails eventually looping back to Vitacura. No ticket required





# ☕️ Food &amp; drink

[**Singular Coffee Roasters**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GefKrd9oMHvU15UQ9)

Small chain with a number of outlets dotted across the city, offering some of the best coffee I sampled in Santiago. Both this and the Providencia site have limited seating and are more geared towards takeaway.

[**Baco**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8WVMYGGT6KUxYkhy8)

A well-styled yet casual-feeling French bistro-styled restaurant - a great place to sample a range of Chilean wines with an extensive wine list available by the glass.

[**La Loncheria** ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hYMSXQx7A3pAUJD68)

I found good food hard to come by in the historical center but this place is a great place to sample a traditional Chilean sandwich. Could happily recommend the Churrasco Italiano, consisting of fried steak, avocado, tomato and plentiful mayonnaise.





# 🏠 Neighbourhoods

The size of Santiago can be deceptive at first glance of a map.

The city's more upmarket and desirable neighbourhoods lie north-east of the traditional downtown area, and due it's size, you should think carefully about where you plan to work from.



✅ [Providencia](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-33.426627,-70.60925&amp;z=12&amp;t=m&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=US&amp;mapclient=embed&amp;q=Providencia%20Santiago%20Metropolitan%20Region%20Chile)

What felt like the best bet for a prolonged stay. A much more contemporary feeling area of the city, with plenty of speciality coffee shops and higher-end bars and dining options. I'd aim to be close to Avenida Providencia between Manuel Montt and Tobalaba metro stations to give convenient access to the Línea 1 metro line.



✅ [Lastarria](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-33.439092,-70.640647&amp;z=15&amp;t=m&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=US&amp;mapclient=embed&amp;q=Lastarria%20Santiago%20Santiago%20Metropolitan%20Region%20Chile)

An ideal option if in town for a couple of days and wanting to be nearer the Centro Histórico. Lastarria is nestled immediately to the east and has a much more refined selection of options for eating and dining. Expect to hear lots of North American accents. Not somewhere I would opt for in the long term due to how tourist orientated it felt.



❌ [Centro Histórico](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=-33.437204,-70.649848&amp;z=13&amp;t=m&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=US&amp;mapclient=embed&amp;q=Centro+Historico+8320138+Santiago+Santiago+Metropolitan+Region+Chile)

Where I regrettably stayed most recently. Worth visiting during the week when it's a bustling commercial hub, but during weekends, large swathes of it feel like an abandoned ghost town. There's a notable lack of modern dining options, with the culinary scene mainly comprised of highly localised interpretations of Chinese food. The area north of Plaza de Armas can feel particularly unsavoury, and it's unlikely this is an area any visitor would want to call home for an extended period.



❌ Las Condes / Vitacura

These huge neighbourhoods are considered some of the safest residential districts within Santiago. Whilst they may make sense as permanent places to live, they felt too disconnected from the core of the city for a short stay. Assuming you won't have a car, unless you're staying close to one of the metro stations on Av. Apoquindo, you'll likely be highly reliant on Ubers to get about.



❌[ Bellavista](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-33.432014,-70.638395&amp;z=13&amp;t=m&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;gl=US&amp;mapclient=embed&amp;q=Bellavista%208420436%20Recoleta%20Santiago%20Metropolitan%20Region%20Chile)

A small hub just north of the Centro Histórico with a range of galleries, restaurants and options for nightlife. It felt fine walking on foot during the day but is reportedly unsafe at night. Probably worth avoiding on your first visit to the city but enjoyable to visit during the day.

**In summary:** As a city to base yourself for remote work, it fell short for me in several key areas. It's worth stopping by for a few nights as a base to explore the rest of Chile, or if you're already in the region.

* Respondents overwhelmingly agreed that the government should act in local neighbourhoods to increase road safety (88%), improve air quality (86%), reduce traffic congestion (83%) and reduce traffic noise (75%).
* Support varied by subgroup. However, respondents were consistently more likely to agree than disagree with interventions across subgroups, with pedestrians and cyclists more likely than car/van drivers to agree to government intervention, and 16-24 year olds least likely to agree than other age groups.
* Three quarters of respondents supported the reduction of road traffic in towns and cities in England (77%) and their local area / neighbourhood (78%), and two thirds of respondents were supportive of reallocating road space to walking and cycling across towns and cities in England (66%) and their local area / neighbourhood (65%).
* Support for reducing road traffic across national and local areas was significantly higher than support for reallocating road space to walking and cycling, although both received high levels of support of two-thirds or more.
* Support also varied by subgroup, but all subgroups were consistently more likely to support, rather than oppose, reducing road traffic and reallocating road space to walking and cycling. Cyclists, pedestrians and those who rent, live in social or other types of housing where among the subgroups who were the most supportive; car/van drivers and homeowners were among the least supportive.
* The four areas considered to be the most serious problems in residential and high streets were: vehicles going too fast (30% residential, 26% high street), not enough car parking spaces (27% residential, 26% high street), heavy traffic (20% residential, 23% high street) and traffic fumes (20% residential, 24% high street). Apart from vehicles going too fast and not enough car parking spaces, all other problem areas were seen to be a more serious problem in local high streets than residential streets.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oxr3e4/public_attitudes_towards_traffic_road_use_and/h7o1kxa/,,"Public attitudes towards traffic, road use and low-traffic neighbourhoods | DfT research and analysis",No

Sure, we'd all like to make it so we need cars less. But the only way you're reducing cars in towns is building more roads/infrastructure around them.

post,Low Traffic Neighbourhood trials suspended - Wandsworth,2020-09-11 18:39:31,"Wandsworth Council is to suspend its Low Traffic Neighbourhood (LTN) trials following a high level review.

The LTN trials were introduced last month to make residential streets more bike and pedestrian friendly and to deter rat run traffic.  


They were part of a series of measures introduced as part of the COVID response by freeing up additional space on the highway in support of social distancing and to promote alternative forms of travel as people gradually return to work.

The trials also supported the council’s ambition of combating climate change by encouraging people to use more sustainable forms of transport and tackling air quality.

However an initial review of the trials has identified concerns with emergency access and traffic flows. And this has been compounded by additional changes that Transport for London (TfL) is making to red route roads in the borough.  


These include significant interventions on the A24 (Balham High Road to Tooting High Street and beyond) including moving bus stops, installing cycle lane segregation, banning turns at a number of junctions and removing parking.

The scale of these A24 changes coinciding with the council’s efforts to establish LTNs on residential streets has caused confusion and long traffic queues.

Additionally, concerns around rising COVID rates and reduced capacity on public transport has meant that alternative travel options are limited for many people at this time.

In light of these initial trial findings the council has decided to suspend the LTN trials.

Wandsworth Council’s cabinet member for strategic planning and transportation, Cllr John Locker said: “We have monitored the traffic flows and listened to feedback from residents and businesses. We have also spoken to our partners including local hospitals and key services to hear the impact on them.

“It is clear that the LTNs are not delivering the benefits we want to see. In fact it looks like the combination of changes in areas like Tooting, where TfL are making changes to the main high road, are unfortunately having the opposite effect. That is why we have taken the difficult decision to pause and re-think about how we can achieve our objective of delivering healthier, safer streets.”

He added: “We all want to do what is right environmentally, whilst maintaining people’s ability to travel and making sure town centres and high streets function properly. It’s important that we listen to what people are saying so that we get this right.”

The Council will continue to review the impact of TfL’s road changes to the A24 in Balham and Tooting to see if the issues improve over the coming weeks.

People are dying due to toxic air in this city, cars take up huge amounts of space and make vast swathes of  London unpleasant to be in, and in most cases are a matter of convenience rather than necessity (the stat that 35% of car journeys are under 2km is especially shocking) - you'd think councils might ignore these dinosaurs and wait for these LTNs to take effect and the gradual shift from cars to public transport and cycling/walking to actually begin before throwing in the towel.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/iqu2yg/low_traffic_neighbourhood_trials_suspended/g4wqupa/,,Low Traffic Neighbourhood trials suspended - Wandsworth,Yes
comment,,2020-09-12 10:53:03,"It's easy to get consultation responses from noisy minorities. Motorists and cyclists can sometimes indentify very strongly with their mode of transport. Pedestrians? Not so much. Children who can't safely walk to school, who can't play in their street, are they going to up and form a local campaigning organisation to represent their interests? Of course not. But they are hugely affected by the dominance of motor traffic.

I do think that it's up to councils to weather any initial angry response and show leadership - particularly if they were elected on manifestos which stated they would encourage walking and cycling. They shouldn't judge the response by how busy their inbox is now, but by how busy it is once everyone has got used to the changes. I bet councillors in Hackney never get emails asking them to rip out bollards put in place back in the 70s, put it that way...

edit - re the mention of manifestos, [this snippet](https://twitter.com/Jo_Earlsfield/status/1304699461046882304) from the Wandsworth Tories' election material in 2018 is interesting.

If the overall capacity of the road network goes down, then less people will drive. Before you say that people need to drive, many people only do so because it's convenient (like a 5 mins drive to the shops for milk, or driving 15 mins to work.). 

This also works in reverse - open a nice new road like a town bypass and you'll get more people taking more journeys as it's suddenly convenient.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/z5jis6/low_traffic_neighbourhood_schemes_cut_air/ixy1o4x/,,Low traffic neighbourhood schemes cut air pollution on nearby roads | New Scientist,No

post,Moved to Malaysia from London for coast-FI retirement. Does semi-retirement in Southeast Asia live up to the hype? Only if you live half a life as an unengaged tourist,2024-08-28 06:49:28,"I have been silently following the other poster (I'm sure you will all know who) for the past year or so, as my path is uncannily similar, but some major differences. I am a regular poster at r/FIREUK but decided to create an anonymous account because it would have been too easy to identify me. Just like I have half an idea of who the other poster is (not hard, as they have been posting incredibly prolifically).

Like that other post, of which parts of I could have copied word for word, this is a plan several years in the making. We have finally moved to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia for almost one month now.

Like the other post, I actually am also living in 'most desirable part of Kuala Lumpur' called Desa Parkcity. Our kid has also just joined the same international school.

Unlike the other poster (who has made his money in recruiting consultancy and are completely FI), we are very close to FIRE, but would need maybe a few years of additional buffer to be comfortable, including going on some expensive holidays, including, as my username suggests, skiing in Hokkaido (did it once and LOVED it). So we consider ourselves coast-FI, and I continue to do contract/ remote work. Plus some level of work is nice and keeps me in touch with society.

Also unlike the other poster, I am Malaysian, though my husband is not. I have lived in Z1 London for over ten years, kid went to a primary school in London etc. So I'm not really an expat, but I am living half an expat lifestyle, and half Malaysian lifestyle.

So here's a REAL perspective, and not tourist rose-tinted glasses 'Just Visiting' perspective. And not a mainland Chinese 'I don't care about society, I only care about my family' crass materialist perspective. (I'm Malaysian Chinese, I can say these things).

**What the quality of living in Kuala Lumpur is like?**

Getting very unhealthy and less fit everyday. Gaining weight. Cars. Roads. Yes, there are nice condos and houses. But you can't get anywhere without a car. We tried living with just a borrowed car, but we gave up. People literally walk from house to car, and that's their extent of their exercise everyday. They HAVE to park at the parking spot nearest to their destination, because god forbid they walk more than 10 meters, their legs have atrophied.

You are probably wondering: this OP is car-obsessed and keeps banging on about cars. No, driving will permeate your every waking moment in KL. Want to pick up kids from school? Join a queue of cars 50 cars long. Want to go to a different mall? Hard to find parking. Want to drive to a place to eat? No parking. Traffic jam. Want to send your kid to a different school? Traffic is very bad. Want to visit your friend across KL? Can't, jam. Most Malaysians will not be aware about how much driving and parking controls every aspect of their lives in KL, but I, as a Malaysian who has lived in London for some time, finds it completely insane. So much productive time just WASTED in traffic. So much time that could be used for exercise wasted.

Desa Parkcity (this 'most desirable part of Kuala Lumpur') is encircled by THREE MAJOR HIGHWAYS, SIX to TEN LANE WIDE. This is life as a most privileged expat. It is very hard to escape from the immediate neighbourhood without driving. Unless you are working from home and/ or go to school nearby, be prepare to drive.

Some people will chime in here and say it's impiossible to walk in 30 degree heat because they are wimps or dullards who can't imagine a better place. Um, hello, your parents and grandparents did just that. In Singapore, people walk back and forth from the MRT station. They don't have to get stuck in major jams. They do not die of heart attack at age 50+, like so many of my parents' friends' have done.

The reason why it's so hot and 30 deg heat and unpleasant for walking, is because a) there are too many cars and b) the whole enviornment was not built for people walking. Trees are cut down, people double and triple park on pavements, roads are widened so cars get priority, instead of the government making things pleasant for people to get some physical exercise or enjoy the weather. Because, guess what, trees cool down the place. Plant trees and the temperature drops to a more bearable 20 - 28 C. That's why forests are so cool in Malaysia. But we can't do that because all the space is reserved for cars, highway and parking.

Desa Parkcity is one of the more 'walkable' areas, and yes, there are cycling and walking paths. But this is Malaysia, drivers have very little regard for people walking, whom they see as 'poor' or 'can't afford a car'.

This it's a far cry from London, where I walk/ take public transport/ cycle everywhere. In London, my kid goes on a seat at the back of my bike and we have little adventures in London. Remember, I live in Z1 London. I point this out because someone is going to tell me that in the outer suburbs of London, it's hard to cycle. Of course it is. That's cos you vote for Conservative councils at your local election. Don't get me started. We are comparing 'the most desirable' Z1 London and 'the most desirable' Desa Parkcity, apples for apples comparison.

As a result, I have found myself gainign weight in the last month alone. Hard to get physical exercise in my day-to-day routine. Also, food is laced with sugar everywhere. Yes, food is cheaper than London, where my Deliveroos regularly exceed £20 for one person. But if you want to eat healthy in Malaysia, there are few options other than to cook.

Also, law is not on your side. Okay, you say, I will just obey the law. But guess what? Things happen. If a Datuk's son drives recklessly and kills your child, the law will NOT side with you. Having a non-corrupted legal system is a privilege. People don't understand what this is until they have lost it. As a tourist staying on a visa for a limited period, the poster will not understand. Until at some point, they will need help from the authorities, and guess what, it will NOT be there. Many expats moved to Malaysia as part of Malaysia My Second Home programme, until 2020, when the government decided to stop the program, and kick expats out of the country. Eventually the government did do a U-turn, but not before many expats had to get out of Malaysia (who have lived for a long time here) very quickly and sell their houses very quickly, at knockdown prices.

Rights? You have no rights as a foreigner. And minimal rights as a Malaysian.

And if you are gay, forget it. Yes, no one will bother you (unless you are Muslim where the religious authorities WILL harrass you), but be prepared to not live a normal life and not have your partner recognised.

Healthcare in Malaysia? Oh boy, that poster will be in for a surprise should anything major happen. The job of a doctor at a private hospital is to make money. Their KPI is to sell you as many products as they can. So expect unnecessary hospital stays, unnecessary tests. Yes, great if you want lots of tests or something straightforward like a knee replacement. But if you have a complication, they will REFUSE and TURN YOU AWAY. Sadly, I have experience of this with my father, who died of cancer. The doctors at the private hospital that he was at recommended some very expensive surgery (covered by insurance, they knew this), but when he refused, as he wanted a better quality of life and his cancer was terminal anwyay, they discharged him and told him they could do nothing for him. My dad went back to public hospital until his death.

See, if he died in the private hospital, it would skew their death rates statistics and KPI. Private hospitals are there to make a profit, and not to treat complicated cases. Sure, they have shiny floors, but you will be back to public hospitals in Malaysia should anything major happen.

NHS has issues, but in some respects, it's fabulous. In my area of London, I had access to the top teaching hospitals. Yes, getting an appointment was hard. But I could walk into A&amp;E anytime without worrying about costs. And I knew the doctor did not have a private profit motive.

Also, other things that will probably fly over the other poster's head because they are not interested at all in building a civic society or community. 90% of life in Malaysia revolves around consumerism/ capitalism and is highly commercialised. Malls - it's a third space for a reason. There is very few public spaces (very few libraries, parks, etc), so privatised malls sprung up in that emptiness. And life is cheap because of the existence of cheap migrant labour. If you are ever annoyed and angry at the UK government/ society at anything that is not money-related, you will be 10000x more annoyed and angry here.

Education. Please don't get me started. I have to pay £10k /yr go to a private international school here, in order to get the same quality as a (free) state school in London.

**So, why did I move back to Malaysia?**

Malaysia is home for me, despite the negatives. I have family here. I want my children to be exposed to Malaysian culture. But we will probably move back to London after a few years.

Also, I will admin that Malaysia has a low(er) cost of living. If you are FI, which we are (mostly), and do not depend on Malaysian salaries, than it can be good. Yes, rent is cheaper and that's a huge factor. Yes, some food is cheaper. The cost is that you are living in a less civic-minded society, less infrastructure and with few legal protections. Your health may suffer also. Also note that children's activities are MORE expensive than in London. Education is MORE expensive for the same quality.

**Edit:** To add, living in Malaysia has its pluses. Certainly great for visiting or doing a digital nomad stint. But that other guy's post was peak expat CRINGE (phrase provided by u/MountainJuice) and so unrealistic of long-term living in Malaysia with a family. The NHS has its flaws but has provided excellent healthcare to me, living in Z1 central London. Remember, we are comparing apples to apples here: Desa Park City 'the most desirable part of Kuala Lumpur' vs Z1 central London with all of London's teaching hospitals and resources.

**Edit2**: Okay going to turn off notifications from this post now. Thanks for all the comments. Excuse all the typos in this post, I was writing this fast and was annoyed. Will probably log off this account and resume regular programming. I also have to sort out my husband's visa, which is a pain.

Someone has asked what my monthly budget is: I don't know, it's still fluctuating at the moment. My best guess is that it is 60-70% of my London expenses. I had to purchase a car (depreciating asset) which knocked my estimates (extra £12K)

An example of some of my other expenses:

* Expat private insurance for the whole family: £4.5K a year (more expensive than 'local' insurance as it covers more conditions and will fly us to SG/ developed country if the expertise isn't in Malaysia)
* Kid private education: £10K a year (in London they would have gone to a state school)
* Rent: £1.5K pm vs £3K in London (I also choose to live in a landed property here with a pool in the gated compound, while London, I would be living in a smaller place with a community pool at the local leisure center a few streets away).
* Libraries: Fewer libraries here and fewer choice, so have to pay £30 pm to get some books for the kdis.
* Cleaners are cheaper (£5 ph vs £15 ph in London) but they are less productive. My London cleaner does a fantastic job in 2.5 hours, while a cleaner here takes longer, I estimate 3.5-4 hours for the same square footage.
* Children activities. Why is this MORE expensive in Malaysia?? As an example, Gymnastics classes once a week costs RM 200-400 per month, equivalent of £35-70 pm, based on quotes from a few providers. Someone is making lots of money here.

Last thing to note that this post was written for a UK audience as this a FIREUK subreddit. So, Malaysians who come to this post and get annoyed that someone is not being optimistic about our country -- there are a lot of issues. Issues that you have accepted or haven't even considered WILL be considered an issue in a developed country. Please stop spending all your time on Shopee (ok, me too) or browse social media on new places to eat. Instead, you need to advocate for Malaysia to bring back local council elections. Because all your unelected DBKL/ MPPJ reps have a job for life and they just DO NOT CARE about your day to day comfort.",179.0,https://www.reddit.com/search.json/r/FIREUK/comments/1f31t4v/moved_to_malaysia_from_london_for_coastfi/,low-traffic neighbourhood,,No

comment,,2024-08-28 20:54:20,"3k is incredibly cheap if I’m honest. Idk how good the doctors are/were but I’d imagine pretty good if it’s a private hospital. 

In the US this can cost up to 50k and in the UK even at NHS prices, it costs the NHS over 3-5k for this procedure all things considered and not close to the level of service you may have gotten. A private hip replacement in the UK costs 15k+ for reference.

comment,,2024-08-29 01:00:09,"Nope, we have quite a severe doctor/surgeon shortage in MY. A lot of our highly qualified doctors choose to immigrate for better pay and career development, and because the gov doesn’t really care about the healthcare staff and they’re highly overworked. Although, the cost to pay for healthcare can be cheap because it is heavily subsidised. And even then, cheap for you doesn’t necessarily mean it’s cheap for locals. Sure £3k is cheap for people with stronger purchasing power, but 40% of locals barely earn £1k/month, another 40% barely £2k. Actual numbers are lower in each of those bracket. 

Doctors working in private hospitals are good, but just like OP said, once they detect a major issue, they’d push the problem to public hospitals because not only they care about their own record, they also don’t have the expertise. Most of our experts are with public hospitals, not private hospitals.

For example, there are 14 cardiothoracic surgeons in the country and all of them are serving in public hospitals. One of the top 3 health issues in Malaysia is heart disease, so there is a long waiting list.

comment,,2024-08-29 08:34:50,"Number is correct and this is widely known data in the country, feel free to do a quick google. Although IJN operates as a private hospital, it is gov-owned under Ministry of Finance. IJN is a heart hospital, and 13/14 cardiothoracic surgeons are there because it’s the largest heart specialist hospital. Most of the surgeons there rotate throughout 7 public hospitals.

Edit: I stand corrected, 72 surgeons in totals. Only 17 specialists now serving gov hospitals. However, I still stand by my statement that surgeons serving private hospitals doesn’t have the level of expertise as the gov-serving specialists, as the practice there is still very dependent on those who are trained and experienced in the public system.

post,Should all of central London become one giant LTN?,2025-06-05 17:52:17,"I’m 100% serious. 

Central London is completely and utterly overstuffed with vehicles, and it’s a nightmare to travel through at the best of times - and that’s to say nothing about the pollution and lung destruction caused, the completely unnecessary traffic deaths, and the insane noise and stress that comes from just being exposed to that.

LTNs and pedestrianised zones are a *literal* breath of fresh air - no more having to worry about getting crushed by a speeding two tonne steel Kevin- or Karen-mobile.

Plus, without personal automobiles, there would be SO much more room for cyclists, which would also mean more room for pedestrians as we could expand the pavements.

Remember, cycling is a the most popular form of transportation in London now, the one least likely to cause the death of fellow road users. 

Clearly, there will need to be exceptions - blue badge holders, emergency vehicles and the like. Busses too, but even those would benefit since there would be virtually zero other traffic to contend with. Delivery drivers could be allowed only outside of peak hours (before 8am, let’s say)

Just the other day in my area, a driver was speeding at 40mph in a 20mph main road, and careened around a corner and hit another car and crushed 3 pedestrians agains the shopfront he ran them into. The paramedics had to literally salt the road to prevent the bloodstains from soaking in. 

I don’t  mean to be graphic, but this is the reality of living in a city congested with cars. 

So why not make it virtually impossible to drive one unless for the aforementioned exceptional circumstances?

Why keep allowing cars to take the piss?

EDIT: pedestrianisation would likely cause an economic boom amongst small businesses in those areas it was implemented as your footfall would be so much higher 

EDIT: yes, i’m fully aware this will either get downvoted to hell or become one of the most “controversial” posts on this subreddit - but i’ll steel man this position till the cows come home

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/Zuo8ZFpmd5): November 14, 2023**

I’m 30s F and caused a major blowup in my family and now none of them are talking to me. For background, my hometown is tiny (500pop) and when I went 2 hrs away to “the city” (15,000pop) for college, I loved it. I ended up staying after graduation, got married, and am happy here for a decade. I visit my home town every few weeks or so, call/text my family near daily, and thought we were all good. My family’s pretty small. Just my brother, mom, step dad, dad, step mom, and an aunt and uncle (mom’s siblings, never married, no kids). My mother's grandparents moved to my home town when I was in high school and were just down the street from us. My family has always been pretty drama free (aside from my parent’s divorce when I was a kid) and we’ve been happy. The step-parents were blended in perfectly and we share holidays and celebrations together. We’re all super close and just the perfect little group.

Ever since I moved away, the topic of “when am I moving back?” is constant, and I’ve always laughed it off. My home town has nothing. You have to drive 30 minutes for milk and bread. 60-90 minute one-way commutes to work. And floods shut down the main road every Easter. I love the town, but I love here more. I have parks, stores, community events, a library! The “city” is great. My family grumbles that I need to move back, but I refuse. I've been trying to encourage them to come here, especially since it's not an hour drive to the nearest medical facility.

Now to the meat and potatoes: both my grandparents passed over COVID times. They were both old and their health had been failing for a while so it was only a matter of time. Thankfully they didn’t catch it, but it made visiting them impossible and we survived mostly through FaceTime. They both passed in their sleep months apart. Both were cremated and kept securely under the kitchen sink for safe keeping while the pandemic blew over. That was 2021.

Well, I just found out my family held a funeral for them and scattered the ashes in my uncle’s maple grove over the summer. No one said a word to me about it. I’ve visited numerous times before and after and not one word. I only found out because my great uncle from California posted on Facebook a few weeks ago that he is entering hospice and was so thankful his health stayed strong enough for him to see his little sister (my grandma) to her final resting place. I was confused and called my mom. She was all “Yeah, the funeral we had in July, remember?” Ya’ll, I visited them for the 4th of July. They did the funeral the 8th. Not a word about it to me. They had planned this for months. Long enough to arrange for my infirm great uncle to be brought over from the other side of the country. Apparently, they talked about it “all the time”.

Everyone is convinced I was at the funeral. They SWEAR I was there. I can prove I wasn’t because Google’s got my location history. My hubby is baffled because he was supposedly there, too, but he had to work every weekend in June and July. Time clock doesn’t lie. My family straight up forgot about me. I’m hurt. I’m sad. And they’re pissed at me “for lying”. They think I’m causing drama over nothing. Nothing I say can convince them I wasn’t there. My family is united in this. And they’ve all put me “on read” until I admit I’m wrong. They think I’ve gone nuts. Either there’s a doppelganger of me attending events, or my family doesn’t want to admit they screwed up. I’m not backing down.

Thanksgiving is coming up, and my family’s been vague posting on Facebook about “forgetful kids” and mental health. It’s so freaking weird and I don’t know if I’m in bizzaro world or what’s going on. My mom’s best friend reached out and said I should just admit I was wrong and apologize, that I’m causing my mom so much unnecessary stress. I asked her if she’s checked everyone’s home for CO2. She hung up on me. (We checked our CO2, and our testers are running just fine.) I have reached out to a few people in my home town to check in on my folks, and they all say they're fine. I even spoke with the local volunteer fire fighter group to see if they could check for gas leaks. Not sure if they were able to.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve shown them the proof I wasn’t there, but they know I’m tech savvy and just assume I’ve Photoshopped it. Hubby says we need a break, and we’re going to be staying home this holiday season.

Edit: I don't know the update rules, so I'll post updates to my profile should anyone want them.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/LtnPfK7sRw): **November 27, 2023 (13 days later)** 

Not sure how to do updates on posts, so figured I'd post anything on my profile. Folks have private messaged me and this will be easier I think?

It's 11/27 and Thanksgiving just happened. Hubby and I stayed home. We got a small turkey and made our own little thanksgiving. It was nice. We ate around noon, then watched a movie, and later sat outside with a bottle of wine to watch the sun set behind the trees and neighbor houses.

We usually take the day before off, drive to my folks, stay the night, and help with the Thanksgiving Day cooking. So it wasn't until Wednesday night that my mom broke the silence. Mom called and asked when I was showing up, and I told her we were staying home this year, but for them to have a happy Thanksgiving, and to give the rest of the family my love. She was quiet for a long time after I said that, and I think she eventually mumbled an ""okay"", or something, and hung up. It wasn't an angry hang up. Just a hang up. On Thanksgiving day, I sent a group ""Happy Thanksgiving!"" gif to our family group chat. I received a few ""happy Thanksgiving""'s back. No one's said anything else. There's been no posts on Facebook.

&amp;nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/CG950OzDkS): **December 12, 2023 (15 days later)**

So, I think I mentioned in one of my comments that my dad and I usually talk on the phone every Sunday morning. We're both early risers so we'd chat over our morning coffees and watch the sunrise. Him and I haven't really spoken since this all went down and it's been tough. I'm used to talking to him, you know?

Well, I was sitting outside in my usual spot, watching the sun rise and freezing my butt off, and he called me. I'm not entirely sure how to describe the emotions I felt. It was a mix of panic, hope, terror, happiness, and dread. I ended up answering because I just had to know what he wanted. It was an awkward conversation. He didn't address the current ""drama"", but instead tiptoed around the situation with all the grace of an cow on stilts. For instance, a simple ""How are you doing?"" Type question was answered with a ""Not good."" And the whole conversation would stall out for a bit because he knew why I wasn't doing well. So we ended up talking about the weather, the various winter birds we'd seen in our feeders, and the Christmas decorations around town. Things like that.

Eventually he asked if we were coming out for Christmas, and sounded sad when I told him we weren't. He asked if him and step mom could come visit us instead, and I told him it wasn't a good idea this year. That hubby and I were going to spend a quiet holiday together. I let him know he should be receiving some gifts at his PO Box any day now, so to please pick them up from the post office and put them under the family tree for everyone. He said he'd ship ours to us as well.

And that was pretty much it. No crazy drama to report. The only posts on Facebook have been the usual Christmas excitement ones, countdowns, photos of Santa, silly gift ideas, photos of company Christmas parties.

On a personal note: Hubby and I are doing alright. Our health is good, our spirits high, and we're as solid as ever. We each got Christmas bonus' at our jobs, so we're excited about that. They're not large, but we're happy to have them. We have also done advent calendars for the first time ever. I got him a Lego one, and he got me a hot chocolate one. We're going to do the calendars again next year. Maybe make a tradition out of it.

Everyone please have a safe and happy holidays.

[Inheritance](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/qyTqATyaIx): **December 16, 2023 (four days later)**

I've received a lot - A LOT - of messages and private DMs urging me to check into inheritance and such. I'm really touched a lot of Internet strangers are worried about me and I wanted to ensure everyone that inheritance is most likely not an issue here. I'd almost be relieved if it was, because then it would at least make some sense. Money does weird things to people, you know?

No one in my family is wealthy by any means. After my grandparents' passed, their small estate was used to pay for their end of life expenses and remaining assets split up. Everyone directly related got an equal split (so excluded my dad and the step parents). I don't remember the exact amount I received, but it was around $5k if I recall. My brother gave me his share, too, so I could finish paying off my college debt while the interest freeze was active.

The great uncle from California has kids and grand kids, and great grandkids of his own, and also isn't wealthy. I think one of his kids makes good money doing something in finance, but I'm not entirely sure. I can't imagine he left us anything, as we hardly knew him. My mom, aunt, and uncle only met him a few times in their lives, and my brother and I even less. Grandma and him were close, but I don't think he liked my grandpa much.

&amp;nbsp;

[Christmas](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/ktVOxyJIlS): **December 25, 2023 (nine days later)**

I hope everyone had a wonderful Christmas. I've received a lot of support through my posts and I'm really grateful. Writing these updates have had a therapeutic effect.

Yesterday was Sunday, but I didn't answer my dad when he called. I just really didn't feel up to a pointless chat, so let it go to voicemail. He tried to reach me a few times throughout the day, but I didn't answer.

Our bestie last minute invited us over to his house for Christmas day lunch (today), so husband and I were busy all Christmas Eve making cookies, peanut brittle, and homemade suckers/hard candies for his kids. Mom tried to reach out as well, but I also ignored her calls.

We had a BLAST at lunch! Our friend's kids are a lot of fun to be around. They got some techy presents from their grandparents (Quest vr headset and steam decks, lucky little rascals) Friend and his wife aren't good with tech, while hubby and I are, so we helped get them set up while our friend played a good host to his folks and inlaws. The grandparents didn't realize that a Steam deck required a Steam account, so we got the kids all their own accounts set up, added them to our steam friends lists, and gifted them some games. We also bought them a few VR games for their headset, and they were off to the races with Beat Saber in no time.

As for my folks: My brother texted and asked if we could talk sometime tomorrow. I think me ignoring mom and dad has caused some kind of upset. Which they deserve.

&amp;nbsp;

[Brother’s call](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/k2sVsFKnow): **December 26, 2023 (next day)**

Spoke with my brother over the phone this morning.

For starters, he apologized for everything. Him and I are good (for now). For a bit of background, my brother and I are only 2 years apart. There weren't a lot of kids around growing up, so the two of us were often stuck doing stuff together. So we have a lot of shared interests and passions. He's been pretty silent on this whole matter, but still ""part of the group"", if you know what I mean. I think the thought of losing him out of my life was probably the most painful, because he's always been there. He was my rock until I met my husband. He's definitely a Mama's boy, though, so anything mom wanted, he made sure she got. I'm happy to have him back.

Without further ado, here's the story from the horse's mouth:

Mom apparently had a cancer scare late last year (which no one told me about, go figure), and dad had a stint put in his heart back in January (which I did know about). This ""sense of mortality"" has apparently lit a fire under Mom's ass to get me back home. But since I wasn't reacting to her passive aggressive hinting, she and step mom decided to go full crazy. My great uncle's health was bad, and he'd been asking about funeral arrangements for his sister (my grandma) for a while, so the moms decided to plan it. And use the event as a giant middle finger to me. They kept all the planning pretty hush-hush between the two of them, so no one on our side of the family actually knew about the funeral until like 2 weeks before. The moms said they'd invited hubby and I. No one thought anything about it. No one thought to mention, confirm, or check with me.

The plan was to scatter the ashes, say a few words, and maybe head to town for lunch. It was a small affair. The mom's didn't even tell the family that our great uncle was coming for it. Like I said, it was a small thing. Barely a footnote. No one thought it was odd because we're pretty chill people.

4th of July happens. Hubby and I are out. No one thought to mention it, as we were all busy celebrating and having a great time. Any time the topic of ""this weekend"" would start, the conversation would be quickly shifted by one of the moms. We went back home.

8th of July happens. Great uncle rolls into town with a few of his kids, grandkids, and great grandkids, and it's a surprise to everyone (but the moms). Everyone drives to the maple grove and the moms have brought a ton of food and stuff. It's a full blown party. No one on my side noticed I wasn't there, because there were so many extra faces outside the usual group. They did the spreading of the ashes, they said their words, they ate, they had a great time. It wasn't until our great uncle left, and all his side left with him, that they realized I wasn't there. And hadn't been there.

And this is where the crazy went up a notch. My brother says the moms were happy no one noticed I wasn't there. And that this was proof to everyone that I needed to move back because I was so easily forgotten about. Because none of them thought to reach out, right? They basically did a ton of guilt tripping manipulation bullshit and it made everyone upset at me for not showing up. Somehow it was my fault for being excluded. So suddenly everyone was on their side with ""sticking it to me"".

But then a few months went by, and tempers cooled, and then I guess the horror of it set in. Followed by the shame, but by then they were ""in too deep"". How do you undo something like this? And since I hadn't brought it up, I guess they figured they would all just stay quiet about it and hope I never asked about a funeral.

That's when I discovered the situation from my great uncle's Facebook and called my mom, who panicked and went with the stupidest solution. Claiming I was there. Don't I remember?

I ended up talking with a few friends from high school, mentioning the situation, and word got back to those in town. So suddenly town gossip and little old church ladies got involved. Was I, or wasn't I at the funeral? Did my family forget to invite me to the funeral of the only grandparents I'd ever know? Or am I just causing a ruckus? My brother said they all just went with mom's answer. Of course they wouldn't forget me. Of course I was there. Of course they're good people. And it just snowballed.

The family expected me to eventually fold. I'm usually a nonconfrontational person, so me sticking to my guns was unexpected. And then I missed Thanksgiving. And now Christmas. With no sign of backing down. And I guess the realization that I could just stop being part of their lives is setting in and my parents are panicking. He's tried just getting them to apologize and explain, but stubbornness prevails. They want to rug sweep, but I'm not letting them.

My brother is upset with everything that's happened. He's realized just how crappy it all has been and he wants nothing to do with it anymore. But since he lives with my mom, he can't ""get away from it"".

He has asked if he can come stay with us for a little bit. I spoke with hubby, and he's in agreement with me that my brother can come crash in our spare bedroom for as long as he wants. Brother works remotely, so it's no trouble for him to pick up and go. I believe he's making the trip today or tomorrow. Not entirely sure, but I expect crap to hit the fan when he arrives.

On a side note, hubby's stoked that my brother and I made up. The two usually game together, but haven't due to ""the situation"". He's downstairs right now setting up his man cave in preparation for my brother's arrival. I'm happy to see him so excited.

&amp;nbsp;

[Brother's Here](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/HOf5rAGNVp): **December 27, 2023 (next day)** 

My brother rolled in late last night. He'd obviously been crying and when I opened the door, he just held me and sobbed. I'd never seen him like that before and soon both of us were just standing in the doorway crying into one another. He kept apologizing. Over and over again. Said he wasn't sure why he went with it. Just kept saying sorry. Hubby got him all set up in the spare bedroom while brother and I talked. My brother's a wreck. He's always been a big guy, but he's lost a lot of weight and his clothes just hang off him. If I didn't know better, I'd think he was on drugs. We talked for a little bit before bed and he re-explained everything for my husband. I'd told hubby the story, but it was just so weird that hearing it again helped. 

This morning my brother was up at dawn making some coffee and getting his work day going. Hubby's off all week (lucky) so hubby made us working folk some pancakes and bacon. So far everything's peaceful. We've decided not to answer any calls from our family. They've been made aware that he arrived safely, and that we are going to spend the New Years together, and that we're not answering any calls until January 1st. They may text if they wish. I'm sure they're losing their minds. Serves them right. 

Everyone, have a safe and happy new years! Don't drink and drive!

&amp;nbsp;

[Happy 2024!](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/OQBOmfSsff): **January 2, 2024 (six days later)**

I hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable holidays, and may the new year be full of joy and happiness!

Not too much of an update. Things here have been quiet. My brother's settled in nicely and he's a great housemate. Our place isn't very big, but we have full basement and a nice outside patio/porch area so it doesn't feel crowded at all with the extra addition. He's a quiet and clean guy. No hassle at all. He got some fresh clothes from the Walmart, a haircut, and trimmed his beard, so he's more ""presentable"" now. He's a lady killer when he gets cleaned up. He's made nice with the (very nosy, but kind) retired couple next door and is adapting to ""city living"" nicely.

Folks back home have been mostly well behaved. There's been a few texts back and forth, as we're not answering calls. Mom mainly wants to know when brother's coming back, but he's keen on staying here for a while. Mom said I can't ""keep him"" and I told her he's a grown ass man and can do what he wants. Brother says he has her blocked after she ORDERED him to return home.

Brother has tentatively asked if he could stay long term, should he decide to, or at least longer than a usual visitor would stay. Which we're fine with. He has a good paying job and could afford an apartment, but he's never lived on his own and I would guess he has some anxiety about it. Should that be the case, he'll start paying us some rent and we'd probably adjust to give him the basement as his own space.
&amp;nbsp;

[Had to change the locks](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/ktBovEqT5T): **January 17, 2024 (15 days later)**

My brother is officially staying with us for the long haul. Hubby and him spent all Sunday organizing the basement and shifting things around so he now has his own area to be comfortable in. He's pretty handy and has also started fixing little things around our house. Our windows and doors have never closed and locked/unlocked smoother. He even fixed one of the closets we never use because we can never get the darn door open. Sadly, he also had to change the locks on our house and get us all new keys.

This is because while hubby and I were out this Saturday, the moms showed up. They'd been calling and texting us all week, but we weren't really answering them, so I guess the two decided to drive over and hash it out in person. They have emergency keys to my place, and just let themselves in. Brother told them to leave, they argued, and my nosy (but kind) neighbors called the police when they noticed the commotion. So, we get a call from neighbor's wife, return home to some cops in our yard, all the neighbors out ""vacuuming their trees"", and my nosy (but kind) neighbors standing on my porch with my brother behind them, doing their best Gandalf ""You shall not pass"" impression.

Had to talk with the cops, explain that we were having a family dispute and word vomited. I don't really remember what all I said, and was shaking a lot. Our local cops are really great. Fantastic guys and gals in blue, and took it all in stride. It's really cold here, so one had me join him in his cruiser with the heat on, and gave me a bottle of water to calm down while we talked. They asked if we wanted the moms trespassed but I wasn't sure if that counted as a criminal charge so just asked the cops if they could just make them leave, which the cops did with no fuss. I think the moms were shocked we were taking this so seriously. They didn't fight or scream at us. Just left quietly.

My dad promised me he'd make sure his wife left us alone. ""Or else"". He said he'd also have a stern talk with my mom. Him and I talked Sunday morning, and he seemed absolutely at the end of his rope. Husband jokingly told my dad he could move in, too. To which he declined.

Not sure where to go from here, but we're getting some ring cameras installed once they arrive. And everyone but my dad is blocked. Hopefully they all just leave us alone.

&amp;nbsp;

[Nothing New To Report]( https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/xuZhQuEREx): **February 2, 2024 (16 days later)**

Had a lot of DMs for updates, but don't have much anything to report on. The moms are behaving themselves. All's quiet on the western front. Felt weird ignoring or copy/pasting ""no updates"" to everyone, so here's what we've been doing, should anyone care.

Dad got a new bird/squirrel feeder from Amazon (looks like a little picnic table for a child's dolly but has a mesh top for the bird seed. I think it's supposed to be for chickens?) It's totes adorbs. To his horror, it also works as a Cooper hawk feeder, so now he's ""fortifying his defenses"" and putting up some trellises around it. He'll have to wait till warmer weather before planting anything to grow on them.

We had some ring cameras installed and put in a motion-activated camera that double functions as a light bulb. It goes in the light fixture outside the front door and is pretty cool. Video quality isn't all that great, but it's a nice addition I guess. It does overlook the bird feeders, so I've been watching it on my lunch breaks on the days I have to go into the office.

Hubby and brother are feuding. They started a coop farm in Stardew Valley a few days ago and they both want to romance Leah. My husband confided in me that he's also been romancing Sebastian as a backup. I'm not sure why he's keeping this a secret, but he's pretty smug about it.

&amp;nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/6pVlXoBULZ): **February 27, 2024 (three weeks later)**

My dad came out for a visit over the weekend. We had a good time and the weather was lovely for some grilling and beers. It was really nice to see him again and he seemed healthy and in good spirits.

Here's his report from back home: Step mom (dad's wife) has started to realize she's screwed up. I credit her change of mindset to the fact that my dad sat her down and laid it out for her: she leaves his kids alone, or she's getting divorce papers. That apparently shut her up right quick, because they had a prenup done when they married and I'm not sure the details of it, but it wouldn't end favorably for her. She hasn't worked in years, so I imagine she'd be eligible for alimony? But I'm not versed in any of that legal mumbojumbo. Dad didn't seem too worried about it, so I'm not gonna worry about it.

Step dad was pissed the police were involved in the last ""mom visit"" (despite no one getting arrested or anything) 
and was in a ""the kids are out of control and need to be reigned back in"" mindset. When my dad pointed out that ""the kids"" in question were all in their mid-30s, it took some of the steam out of stepdad's sails. According to my dad, even my mom looked a little surprised when he said that. So, part of me is wondering if a good chunk of this whole thing is my mom not truly realizing that her kids were grown, and no longer children she could make demands of. Both of the moms have left us alone. I expected my mom to continue to kick up a fuss, but I think the cops spooked her.

There was a wonderful suggestion by a comment or to get their pastor involved, which I passed along to my dad. Dad has since spoken to their pastor about everything. He's a young guy, relatively new to their church, and joked that his first month on the job he had to do 3 funerals in a row and his new ""flock"" were just dying to get away from him, so he's got a sense of humor which is nice. The new pastor agreed to sit down with everyone and help the family hash it all out in a true ""Come to Jesus"" type moment next month, so that maybe we could celebrate Easter together as our first holiday as a family. Dad said the pastor was aware our family was having some troubles, but unsure of exactly what was going on, and since he was new, the pastor didn't want to pry. He has also agreed to do a small service down at my uncle's maple grove later in the summer, as it usually floods and is a muddy mess all spring. According to my dad, my aunt and uncle are so over all the drama and just ready to move on, so I expect hugs and apologies from them when we next meet.

Stardew Valley Update: My brother was victorious in the grand fight for Leah. It was a hard battle. Well fought. When my husband exposed his plans to woo Sebastian all this time, it was quite the betrayal. Dramatics aside, their farm is really cute and I'm so happy they're enjoying the game!

&amp;nbsp;

[Update 4/1 - Final one I think](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/Vu27IFAIM8): **April 1, 2024**

Happy April Fools everyone! I hope you all check your caramel apples for stray onions before taking a bite! I also hope your Easter weekend was a delightful one.

It is with great joy that I tell you all about our most recent update! Possibly even a conclusion to this whole ordeal.

The entire family (aunt, uncle, moms, dads, brother, me, husband) and pastor met at my dad's house and we all sat down to hash the situation out. As expected from what my dad said, my aunt and uncle greeted us all with apologies and hugs, which was nice. My uncle usually helps host the Easter egg hunts with the church and he brought our Easter baskets to give to us in case us kids weren't sticking around the for the weekend. I'm not sure why but seeing it made me tear up and feel stupid, because it was just a basket of candy but it meant a lot to me for some reason.

The pastor led us in a prayer and talked about forgiveness and such. He then asked us all to talk one at a time about how we're feeling and what we want the end result of today to be. No one was allowed to interrupt so everyone got to talk. It was nice. The consensus for the group was that most everyone wanted things to go back to ""normal"". The only ones who had any variance off this was my mom and step dad. They both wanted all us kids to move back to the area.

The pastor asked them why they wanted us back, and neither could give a good reason other than ""because family"", and the pastor asked us if we were thriving where we were. And we said we were. He asked if we were happy there. Which we were. He then asked my mom and step dad if they wanted us to give up our happiness to make them happy.

And Mom broke down and said no. We all had a good cry. The pastor then asked about the funeral and lies that led up to it and followed it and how it made us all feel and what we wished we'd done differently if we had the chance. It was all very emotional, but in a good way, you know? Everyone apologized and admitted they f-ed up and did a really crappy thing.

We all talked for a long, long time and the pastor was a great mediator. Eventually we all reached some sort of resolution and I think we're good now. Emotions are still high and a little raw in areas, but we stayed for Easter weekend and had a nice time. We're going to keep moving forward slowly and try to repair the relationship, but I believe we're well and truly out of the woods.

As for my brother, he's still staying with us, and mom will stop trying to guilt trip him back home. He's thinking about renting a small apartment in our area but we're not pushing him to make a decision. He knows he's welcome to stay as long as he wants. I think he wants to try dating (he's had a few girlfriends but never anything serious) and is embarrassed to bring any girls around our place, lol. He's been going to a few random classes/bookclubs at the local library for something free to do and hitting it off with all the little old ladies who attend, and they keep trying to hook him up with girls his age who they know. He has been on a few lunches/coffee dates with a couple girls, but I think he's too embarrassed by the attention to give it a real try at ""dating"" any of them. He's happy, though, which is all I could ask for.

I'm not sure if there will be any more updates, as I think it's all be resolved about as much as it can be at the moment. I wanted to thank you all for your words of advice and giving me a place to vent and scream into the void. Please be kind to one another and to yourselves. Thank you.

&amp;nbsp;

[Small, happy update](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/jbA3zFl2AK): **May 7, 2024**

Things as wonderful as the moment. Still doing baby steps with The Moms. We're texting and talking on the phones more, which is nice. Very civil.

Dad ""accidentally"" bought a bunch of hand crafted bird feeders at a craft fair. By accidentally, I mean: he had a little too much fun in the beer tent, went for a stroll while step mom wasn't looking, and stumbled upon a guy's booth and bought ""one of each"". He wouldn't tell me how MANY ""one of each"" was, but he cackled like a witch when I asked. Step mom said she's forcing him to give a few to me, so I'm expecting a delivery or a Dad-visit any day now.

My brother is officially ""going steady"" with a girl. We've met her a few times and she seems like a real sweetheart. She's our age and has a little boy (5-6 years old, I haven't asked) from a previous relationship (The dad's not in the picture from what I can gather). She's the granddaughter of one of his Book Club members, so the old ladies made good match makers in the end. The relationship is still very new and I'm routing for them.

No new Stardew Valley updates. Work has been a little crazy lately and I haven't been able to play much of anything, and brother has been distracted by his new lady friend. So, husband finally started Baldur's Gate 3, and fell for Gale's ""magic trick"" so now those two are a thing. I expect him to be sufficiently distracted from reality for the next few weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Been a while](https://www.reddit.com/u/justathrowaway282641/s/RlgDOkYBME): **March 3, 2025 (10 months later)**

I hope everyone's doing wonderful! I know it's been a while. Lots of little happy updates incoming!

My brother moved out! He's like 5 minutes away, so it's not far but he's officially living on his own. He's going steady with the same girl. She's a catch! Sweet as can be! She fits in to the family so well and everyone just adores her. She's going to school to be a nurse and I know she's gonna crush it. Hubby and I get to babysit her kiddo on the regular and he's a total hoot. At first, he was overly polite and a bit shy, but one day my husband picked him up and husband was wearing his SCP hoodie. Turns out the kid is a MASSIVE SCP fan. So we've all bonded and he's really opened up around us. Assuming my brother and her are still together come August (we're hoping they continue going strong) there's talk about kiddo taking the school bus to our place after school. There's a stop at the bottom of our street and it would be no trouble for us to have him chill at our house for a few hours until mom's off work. Have him work on homework or whatever. I might have to learn whatever ""new math"" is, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

Mom's mellowed the frick out. She's stopped her insanity and seems to have accepted the new normal. Dad says she's ""turning back into the woman he once married."" Which is a bit depressing, but also good, I guess? From what he says, mom has started cross stiching again. Which, my brother and I never knew she knew how. Apparently, she used to be massively into the hobby, but after my brother and I were born, she was terrified we'd get into the needles and hurt ourselves, so she put it all away and never touched it again. Step-dad says she's much more relaxed and calm lately, which I'm happy about. She's respected our boundaries and has only come to visit when we allowed it. Our relationship has improved drastically.

Dad and step-mom are also doing well. Step mom and us actually bonded quite nicely during January. She needed hip surgery and since Dad's house has more steps than High Hrothgar, it was decided that she would stay with my husband and I. Her doctor scheduled the surgery at our local branch of their hospital and after she was released, she came back to our place. She ended up staying with us for most of January due to a massive ice storm that came tearing through the area. I've spent time with the woman, but never like this or for this long. It was like seeing a whole new side of her I never knew. When dad finally came to pick her up, I was actually sad to have her leave.

You will all be happy to hear that we did manage to do a memorial for my grandparents. It was exactly what my soul needed. I didn't realize how much I NEEDED to have that closure until it was done. Like someone took a weighted blanket off me and I could breathe again. It was a lovely service and a few of the little old church ladies made us some finger foods to have back at the church afterwards and we all sat around eating and sharing stories about Grandma and Grandpa.

Our next scheduled visit is for Easter and I can honestly say I'm looking forward to it. I feel like I have my family back again.

Please be kind to each other and take care of yourselves. Thank you for letting me shout into the void.

**Commenter:** Oh this is a fantastic update. I am so pleased that this whole saga has come through the other side in a **nice** way. So often these kind of things don’t have happy endings and I’m thrilled that this one does. Thank you for updating us all.

post,I think 2.0 can (with one addition) replace (most of) LTN,2024-09-23 09:44:56,"EDIT: u/Flyrpotacreepugmu [pointed out below](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1fnf23g/comment/lohsysz/) that this wouldn't work. You still need a way to allow multi-requester stations to request one item but not another. If a station requests iron plates and copper plates, but is full of copper plates, you want it still to be enabled (so it can receive iron plates), but somehow not receive copper plates. You could prevent the inserters from unloading anything from a copper plate train, but then it would just sit there, occupying the slot. Maybe you could use a signal to send it away early, but that's still not ideal. So you really do need a way to control the station name by circuits.

I need to go to bed, but this idea started kicking around in my head and now it's all of your problem :)

I've been fighting with LTN in my SE run and reread the train improvement FFFs ([389](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-403), [395](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-395), and [403](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-403)) and I think they are one feature short of obviating (most of) LTN. That feature is the ability for interrupt-scheduled stops to pattern-match on the destination name to enable multi-requester stations. So you could name a station ""`[copper-plate][iron-plate] Drop`"" and set the interrupt to ""`[any-item]+ Drop`"" where the plus character behaves like in [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), matching one or more of any item. So if a train picked up some copper plates, it would still match the station ""`[copper-plate][iron-plate] Drop`"", even though there was a different item between ""`[copper-plate]`"" and "" `Drop`"".

For some context, I like creating dropoff stations like this:

[That's requesting 9 different items at the one stop](https://preview.redd.it/gtrf4mq9aiqd1.png?width=1811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c043c45fa6a6d2660569e7bf223ff965083fe5a)

This enables feats of city-block spaghetti like this:

[40 SPM of each energy science in a 128x128 tile block](https://preview.redd.it/cy8rz504biqd1.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfba3b33a3049204fa8f79afb8d1f055beedfeb8)

And I'm hoping that I can continue this madness in 2.0/SA.

So here are the different problems to solve multi-providers and multi-requesters, along with my proposed solutions in 2.0:

# Provider thresholds

Read the chest contents and use a selector combinator to get the stack size and disable the station if the number of stacks is below a threshold. If you want to have the station provide some items but not others, set inserter filters only for those items which the station is actually ready to provide.

So if a station provides both copper plates and iron plates, and it has lots of iron plates right now but few copper plates, set the inserter filter to iron plates only.

# Provide multiple items

This actually isn't that bad because of interrupts. Just dump everything into the train. Because the train chooses its interrupt destination based on its contents, you don't need to worry about only supplying the train with what it asks for. The model isn't ""create a route from A to B, picking up item X"", it's ""station A enables itself, and when a train arrives, dump whatever you have into it."" This fixes the problem of trains ending up with unexpected cargo, since they'll just route to any station which wants whatever they currently have.

# Request multiple items

This is where you would need the pattern matching thing above. A station would have a name containing all of the items it wants, and the interrupt would pattern match the station based on what it has in inventory.

# Withhold trains if no demand

This was the other big idea I had. One nice thing about LTN is that it avoids dispatching trains to providers if there aren't any requesters which want what it has. Here, I came up with two parts: buffer depots and radar-connected signals. I'll call the supply of an item above the provider threshold that doesn't have any demand the ""pending supply"". If a copper ore provider station has its buffer chests totally full, but no copper ore requester stations are currently requesting copper ore, then the network has a ""pending supply"" of copper ore, which lives in the copper ore mine station.

The key idea here is changing where pending supply lives. A ""buffer depot"" would be a station where trains go when they have pending supply. So in the example above, a train would go to the copper ore mine, pick up some copper ore, but when it tried to go to a copper ore requester, all of them would be full. This would be like the situation in ""The depot problem"" from [FFF-389](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-389). However, this interrupt would trigger only if the cargo inventory was **not** empty and while processing another interrupt (the full dropoff).

The train waits in the buffer depot until a requester for its items opens up. The buffer depot is set to a high priority, so trains will leave it first.

The final piece is that trains at the buffer depot need to tell provider station not to request trains, even if they have plenty of items. For this, I thought of reading the inventory of trains stopped at buffer depots, normalizing the value to 1 (we only care that this item exists at a buffer depot, not how much there is), and then putting that on the radar network. Provider stations, when deciding whether to enable themselves, would check the buffer depot signal and disable themselves if there is a buffer train. This way, you wouldn't have a bunch of trains loading up on copper ore if the copper plates are backed up.

# Circuitry for multi-provider stations

With all of that together, the circuitry for provider stations would look like this:

1. Chests are all wired together.
2. The total inventory gets divided by the stack size of each item (using a selector combinator).
3. If the stack size of an item is above the provide threshold, output 1. This means the station has pending supply.
4. Use an arithmetic combinator to compute `1 - each` from the radar network and multiply that by the station's pending supply. This removes any items which exist in a buffer depot.
5. Now, you have a 1 for any items which the station actually wants to provide right now, so set the inserter filters with this signal and if `anything &gt; 0`, enable the station.

This should work to make it so that you only have one (or maybe a small number) of trains in buffer depots at any time, and otherwise have provider stations stay empty until they are actually ready to fill up a train now.

# Conclusion

Maybe this idea is totally crazy, but I needed to get it out of my head. If we don't get pattern-matching interrupt names, then we could still have multi-providers, just not multi-requesters. Maybe a mod could either add pattern-matching interrupt names or (perhaps more simply) dynamically change station names based on signals.

# Note: partial loads

This system couldn't do complex partial loads, such as ""station A requests 1,000 copper plates, station B requests 2,000 copper plates, so a train going to C to pick up copper plates will only load 1,000 if it is going to A."" A train wouldn't know where it is going until it decides to depart. However, I've never needed this ability, even with the extreme levels of spaghetti in my 300+ hour (so far) SE game. You might be able to rig up something like that with the radar network, but you'd be fighting against the interrupt-push-based model of the 2.0 scheduling.",92.0,https://www.reddit.com/search.json/r/factorio/comments/1fnf23g/i_think_20_can_with_one_addition_replace_most_of/,LTN,,No

post,"How to share the same trains for different items, LTN style, without mods",2025-11-19 21:14:59,"Hi! I just figured this out and hadn't seen it on any tutorials, so thought I'd share:

The goal is to create ""LTN style"" trains where all trains are dynamically dispatched to any pickup, and any drop off, instead of having dedicated trains per item type.

1. set up your stations with names ""&lt;item icon&gt; load"" and ""&lt;item icon&gt; unload"". You can have as many of each as you want.
2. set up your refueling stations all with the name ""refuel"". Set going here as your train's only normal schedule
3. set up a ""unload"" interrupt: ""has cargo in inventory"" -&gt; target station ""&lt;item wildcard&gt; unload"". Lots of youtube tutorials cover this part.
4. Set up the ""pickup"" interrupt: condition is ""signal parameter"" which is the green curly wildcard. target station is ""load &lt;signal parameter&gt;"". Whenever the train receives a &lt;copper&gt; signal, it will now go to a ""load &lt;copper&gt;"" station!
5. Sending the signal: wire the chest at your unload station to a decider combinator, which will output the item if there is not enough of it. for instance, output &lt;copper&gt; if &lt;copper&gt; is less than 1k.
   1. This signal needs to reach the refueling stations to trigger the pickup interrupt! Send it through the wireless radars!
   2. But first it needs to go through a ""one way valve"" so that other signals on the radar don't come back to mess with this station. I do that with wildcard arithmetic combinator that just multiplies by 1.
6. Enabling the correct station: If you have multiple pickup stations for the same item, you'll need to keep them normally disabled, and only enable when the circuit condition is met. Just make the decider combinator also output a checkmark, and use that to enable/disable the station.

Hope this is helpful to anyone who liked LTN :)

post,Tutorial for LTN-like trains in vanilla,2025-05-07 15:54:54,"When starting SA, I was actually concerned LTN is discontinued (now it's already 2.0 ready) so I was looking for alternatives, tried few and Railway Logistics Dispatcher seemed to be promising. Eventually, I started vanilla for achievements and was all the time thinking how to do train stuff without mods. And here we are. It's possible to set up your train network only with interrupts. Totally generalized trains, only two types (for cargo and fluids). No radars, nor waits or advanced wiring. Just interrupts. And I would say it's even more effective since these mods usually uses depot station as the train's home and only updates its route when there.

Aside of common refuel, there is need for three different interrupts: Load, Unload and Depot if train is not needed.

**Setup:**

There are multiple ways how to achieve this, but let's have ALL stations that supply something to be named same name - 'Supply""/'Fluid Supply'. (If you want to identify stations or factory, you can use map tags). Let's unify ALL requesters as '\[resource icon\] Unload'. You can ofc differ station names by expected train sizes and categorize your trains accordingly. In this example, only one train size (2+4) is used. Set all station limits to 1, unless you are using waiting tracks.

I guess this should be pretty straightforward. If the train is empty, go to supply station and wait until full.

[Loading interrupt](https://preview.redd.it/uc2ct1cc2dze1.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6db9002b4df99c500e5708a7e8f7c9aab695ff36)

Note: You need to recreate another interrupt for fluid trains because different station name.

**Unloading trains:**

Unloading is where stuff starts to be funny. Since the train is full after loading interrupt finished, we need to check cargo type and properly select unloading station accepting loaded items. To achieve this, you'll need to set a condition with exact cargo that contains a wildcard item parameter, which is then properly propagated to a target station. You'll need to write this station name manually. Wait condition is clearly waiting for the train to be empty.

[Unloading interrupt](https://preview.redd.it/xfrqflo1qdze1.png?width=442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32a0367c5b4f3c4879ed92dce017788771099d03)

Note: You need to create another interrupt for fluid trains with wildcard fluid icon.

What will happen? When the train is full, item parameter (icon) is loaded and propagated to the target station name. The train will try to find the closest one with proper name and if there is no available, it will wait in supply station until any will be free to accept loaded cargo.

**Depot:**

Since now fine, basically you'll start filling your network with trains, but it will get eventually clogged because trains that unloaded their cargo want to go to stations supplying cargo which are occupied by trains blocked by occupied unloading stations. So, to resolve this deadlock, we want the train that doesn't have a proper target loading station to park it in the depot until it has somewhere to go.

So, firstly, setup some depot parking like this and don't forget to set trains limit to 1 for each depot station.

[Depot](https://preview.redd.it/2uuac7il4dze1.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40a342416fcd0debd461eec62cc21a1dbfe6335e)

For depot interrupt, we want to trigger it when target station is not available, and we want to trigger it only for empty trains since full has to wait in loading station otherwise your depot will be flooded with full trains and clogging whole network. Target will be depot without any waiting condition. This will lead into instantly triggering the loading interrupt after arriving into depot. Which will retrigger to depot if there is still nothing to do and since it's already sitting in depot and trains always chose the closest station, it won't do anything, just sit, and wait in the loop until some supply station becomes available.

Important: don't forget to tick checkbox allowing interrupting other interrupts.

Note: Set some basic, e.g. 5-10s wait if having like 100+ trains to avoid constantly looping in depot&lt;&gt;load interrupts.

**Refueling tips:**

It should be easy for you to create this interrupt by yourself, but here are some optimization tips:

\- Set condition to fuel less AND empty cargo. Because if you don't tick the empty cargo, your train might get refueled full, and if target unloading will be occupied and since depot condition is only for empty trains, your train will be stuck in refueling station blocking others.

\- Set condition to fuel wildcard and set it like &lt;30. This allows you to have multiple refuel stations (useful for bigger networks) and mixed fuel types (wood/coal/solid/rocket).

\- Don't set target condition to full fuel if you use mixed fuels because obviously you will never fill those locomotives.

\- If transitioning to nuclear fuel, stop using wildcard and set condition to like nuclear fuel &lt; 2. Replace all your refuel stations with nuclear fuel and make there unloading chest for each locomotive that takes out of them everything that is no nuclear fuel.

\- Don't forget to tick interrupting for interrupts checkbox.

**Optimization tip for lowering amount of trains in the network:**

You might have noticed on the first screenshot that my unloading stations are red. They are red because they are disabled by wiring. What am I doing is disabling stations when trains cannot be unloaded. Why? Because it doesn't make sense having train sitting in supply and requester stations, so basically the idea is to limit amount of trains and overall logistics. How am I doing this? Connect all chests in requester station to train stop, calculate chests capacity, deduct train capacity and set stop to be enabled when under threshold. In this example, there are 4 wagons, each handled by 4 chests. So, chest capacity is 48 stacks by 50 (for ores) by 4 chests by 4 wagons, totalling in 38400 resources. Train capacity is then 40 stacks by 50 by 4 wagons, totalling in 8000. So, a train could properly unload if there are less than 30400 resources in the station. I've rounded down and using 30/60/120K for different stack sizes. It's kind of annoying, but since you start doing that, copy/paste eases the whole process. Also, for this, unloading cargo wagons needs to be properly balanced.

[Train stop wiring setup](https://preview.redd.it/tew363rd6dze1.png?width=193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2225b1596a5685fdbc518ebfa97506ac9aa9ef5f)

Same way, you might optimize requesters, either by enabling them or with some logic, set the number of allowed trains by remaining space in chests so they are able to fully unload. However, my experience showed, that in such case, you will still need specific amount of trains, but since they will be blocked either in loading stations or depots, you will never know the exact number. This might lead into situation that when factory production peaks, as trains prefers closest stations, they might supply only specific materials while others will be in deficiency. When not using any wires, all you need to check is that there is simply one train (per type) sitting in depot, since all loading and unloading stations should be always occupied. This way, you should always know when to add more trains.",65.0,https://www.reddit.com/search.json/r/factorio/comments/1kgxyee/tutorial_for_ltnlike_trains_in_vanilla/,LTN,,Yes

Obviously throwaway, I don’t need anyone here seeing my regular account. Also I’m in the US and English is my first language, any discrepancies are because I suck at typing on my phone.

So TL/DR for the “give me the bare bones, I don’t have all day to read on the shitter” crew: My #1 sex rule since high school has been no sex before the third date. I recently broke that rule with a handicapped guy, and now my childhood best friend is pissed and grossed out because she thinks I have some weird kind of fetish.

Context/full story: I’m a 28f. My childhood best friend we’ll call Jess is also 28f. To put it simply, I don’t think I’m any kind of prude, I just don’t really feel comfortable with casual sex, never have. My best friend knows this and has teased me about it lightly in the past. She’s been in a long term relationship for the last 3 years, I’ve mostly been single while working on my degree and starting my career. Jess lives in another state with her boyfriend, so we don’t hang out much anymore.

So about a month ago I had a first date with a guy I’d been talking to for a bit, thought it was going places, but he gave a WEIRD vibe on the date and I cut and ran early. On my way home I stopped at a local pub, figured I’d have a drink to unwind and people watch till it wore off. (Tipsy driving is still drunk driving IMO.) I get there and it’s pretty packed, Friday night and all, and there was no seating room at the bar. Took my drink and looked around, most of the “restaurant” side of the pub was someone’s birthday party, but there was a small table with a seat open off to the side, with a guy reading a book there. So I say eff it, I’m a social person and what’s the worst thing that happens, he says no? So I ask if I can sit there for a bit, I promise we don’t have to talk or anything.

At this point I feel like I’ve fucked up because this guy up close is *the hottest man I have ever seen*. But he just smiled at me and gave an enthusiastic “Sure!” A few minutes later of me sipping in silence and he says “I don’t mind talking, if you want to.” (Yeah I want to are you kidding me right now?) We talk for a bit and it turns out Mike (fake name) is 29, just finished his master’s degree in some kind of computer learning field (“I program computers to program computers”) and he’s living on his own for the first time. He apparently stops by the pub after work because he’s right around the corner, and he’s not used to the silence yet after living so long with a half dozen siblings.

We talked for a good two hours, about everything from dating (which he said he’s basically given up on) to hobbies and tastes, and we have a near total eclipse of a venn diagram on this stuff. I eventually sort of blurted out that I don’t know why he’d give up on dating, this is the closest thing I’ve had to a good date in forever. (Shooting my shot obliquely here lol.) He gets kind of an odd look on his face and says “Tell you what, I have to go to the bathroom, but when I come back I’ll ask you out for real.” Weird, but okay?

Then it all clicks, because he doesn’t get up to walk away, he just rolls. In his wheelchair. And I’m thinking “oh my God he wanted to give me a chance to back out of this without making it awkward how cute can this guy BE.” He grinned like crazy when he got back and saw I was still there, and I basically tripped over myself saying something to the effect of “So I’m free all weekend, what did you have in mind?”

Another hour later, we’ve got plans for Saturday, and he told me he has a neuromuscular disorder I can’t remember the name of (my degree isn’t in STEM lol) so his legs work, but the signals from his brain get misinterpreted so he doesn’t have the balance or coordination for walking or standing. The pub starts switching over to the younger/rowdier crowd and he asks if I’d like to go back to his place for coffee to continue our conversation.

As you have probably long since realized, I did not get any coffee or conversation till the next morning and I have ZERO regrets. We’ve been dating since and I know it’s still early but I really feel like this might be the one.

Onward to yesterday afternoon, my friend Jess (remember Jess?) is in town, and we go out for coffee to catch up on things. I’m gushing about Mike, but when I get to how we met she just sort of got weird and edgy. I don’t remember any exact words but she essentially said that I must have a fetish for the handicapped since I broke my #1 rule and it’s the best physical relationship I’ve ever been in. Like it’s good for me because he uses a wheelchair, not because the guy puts in effort in bed??? She said I’ve “changed” as a person and left without even saying goodbye. 15 years of friendship and I’ve never seen her like that.

So here I am, asking the most objective people online (haha) if I’m an asshole or weird for being super attracted to a guy who uses a wheelchair and basically putting out immediately.

[\[UPDATE\] AITAH For breaking my Number 1 sex rule with a handicapped guy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1c85ds3/update_aitah_for_breaking_my_number_1_sex_rule/?share_id=i5gwYUdrRGHwS4iwfHXqr&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1) - April 29, 2024

My first ever update! Yay! Uh, so if you were hoping for some terrible drama, I hate to break it to you that I don’t roll like that. No pun intended. So I do have an update on Jess and shit finally makes perfect sense. And I have a slightly NSFW but funny story about Mike, because this guy is just the best, y’all.

Okay, so first, I finally messaged Jess yesterday and said basically “I’m still hurt by what you said, but after 15 years of friendship I’d never forgive musif I didn’t at least ask why you snapped at me like that.” She replied immediately, “I’m so fucking sorry, I didn’t mean any of that, can we have a do over on lunch?” So I agreed cautiously and took a half day to meet with her today.

Turns out that those of you who said she was jealous, and that she might have something else going on, and especially the person who said something might be going on in HER relationship….. gold stars. She’s in town because she’s job hunting, because she’s moving back in with her parents for a while since her relationship ended. Apparently they have been having a ton of small problems adding up, but the biggest one? Sex. The guy she’s been with was apparently never great but it’s gotten to the point where he makes no effort at all for her to enjoy herself and then gets pissed when she isn’t in the mood. She tried talking with him about it, making suggestions but he told her recently that it’s “emasculating” being given sex advice by a woman. The straw that broke the metaphorical camel’s back, however, was that her boyfriend has always had a thing for Asian women. She’s caucasian, but she does have long black hair. After weeks of fighting over their sex life, he suggested that they spice things up….by her dressing in a kimono and pretending to be Asian. She lost it on him and is absolutely disgusted by the racist fetishism and ended it right then.

So she had allllll of this bottled up and was hoping to talk to me and finally be able to put it down….. and I missed every hint that she had something big to discuss because I was gushing about Mike. So to her it felt like I was just twisting the knife by bragging about how great our sex was. She snapped, and somewhere between what I was saying and what she wanted to talk about some wires got crossed and she said something incredibly dumb. She left without saying goodbye because she was mortified and ashamed as well as irrationally mad at me. Something to know about Jess, she’s an awful liar and she and I were the co-founders of our high school’s “foot-in-mouth” society, so I do believe her. I told her I forgive her and I’m sorry I didn’t realize she wanted to talk about something bothering her, and she said I was too stupidly nice and have nothing to apologize for, so I think we’ll be okay. For the time being I’m not ready for her and Mike to meet, because I don’t want to make things feel worse, and she agrees. But she’s really really happy for me. Hopefully this is just a funny story we can look back on someday.

So, on to how Mike almost killed me, lol. Last night we were talking about the reddit post and he gets this funny expression that I’m starting to recognize. And he goes “How do we know you don’t have a fetish if we haven’t at least tried it in the chair?” And I’m like “are you serious lol”. He said he’s never attempted it, because (cue tears) he’s never felt so comfortable with a partner before. Well.

His chair has what is essentially like a parking break thing. Or it should, it’s unfortunately broken and apparently getting them fixed is an expensive pain in the ass. He doesn’t use it that often so he hasn’t made it a priority. And there’s this thing called Newton’s third law, you know how every action has an equal and opposite reaction? As it happens, when you’re trying to, ah, get the motion of the ocean going, in a chair with wheels that aren’t locked, there’s a sort of counter motion that starts and fucks it all up. So we were going nowhere fast except for inching along the floor in his bedroom. And laughing at the silliness, which isn’t helping. Eventually he just stops and says “Maybe we can get some of those wooden block things they use to keep little planes from rolling away, like in Indiana Jones you know?”

I absolutely lost it. Like laughing so hard I’m in tears, he’s giggling half at the situation and half at my reaction, and everything just keeps setting me off again. FINALLY I get it under control, doing some deep breathing exercises and shit, and I look at him again. And he pulls the straightest face he can, and says, for the love of god, “Golly. This sure is uncomfortable.” Folks if I had asthma I would have fucking died right there. I laughed so hard I think I pulled a rib. Like wheezing and not even laughing anymore so much as weeping and making this awful “heeeeee” noise when I could catch my breath. While he’s laughing and rubbing my back and saying he’s sorry, he couldn’t resist.

So yeah, confirmed, no fetish here, and this magnificent bastard’s comedic timing might actually kill me.

I doubt I’ll update again, because there’s really nothing I can see needing to share given everything sort of worked out. And in the end, the real assholes were the….friends we made along the way? Idk. Thanks for all the lovely comments on my last post and for coming along with me on this absurd but brief drama in my life, lol.

[\[UPDATE\] Am I the Asshole for breaking my sex rule with a handicapped guy: met his family. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1cr8f7p/update_am_i_the_asshole_for_breaking_my_sex_rule/)- May 13, 2024

Hello again! I was going to post this on my own page but a few people mentioned that they think it’s nice to read on AITAH, so fuck it, here’s the “met Mikes family” update. And it's a doozy, or at least felt like it at the time for a girl who grew up with a small, dysfunctional family.

So first up, you know what people (at least me) don’t think about when dating a guy who’s always sitting? Height. I know he’s taller than me because we cuddle a lot, and he’s taller sitting on the couch, but I didn’t reeeeeeally get it. So we drive up Friday night after work (actually south and west, lol, but to my brain it’s always up) in his vehicle, which is modified to be driven entirely using his hands. Neat, right? He’s a really good driver too. One more green flag. We get to the house, and it’s…. It’s huge you guys, LOL like not a mansion, just kind of a sprawling one floor rancher. Real estate was wild back in the day.

Anyway we get out, and I meet his mom. I’d like to point out I am no slouch, I’m 5’-friggin-7. His mom is TOWERING over me. But she was the nicest lady ever. We go inside and I meet his dad (who funny enough is apparently the only short one in this family) and his youngest sister, who is living there with his one year old niece. She gets up to hug me and SHE IS ALSO REALLY TALL. It’s already a bit late then, so we eat and head to bed, I get to see his cute as shit room from when he was a teenager, and I casually ask “hey, so uh, I don’t know how this works and stuff, but how tall are you?” and Mike is all “I dunno, like a bit over 6’4? Been a while since I checked.” A BIT OVER 6’4. “So, is everyone in your family tall?” “…..kinda?”

We met the Nordic Basketball team he calls a family properly the next day. (Actually they’re Irish, but they’re blond and tall so it conveys the idea better.) The ONLY one of reasonable height, and still taller than me, was his oldest sister, lol.

They are also LOUD. Like not really shouting or anything usually, just, PRESENT. Mike is a lot different around them, but in the cutest way, like he just beams all the time and you can see how happy he is to be home. One of his brothers put him in a headlock and gave him a dang NOOGIE as a greeting, and got elbowed in the side for it, and all of them laughing. And his mom smacked one of his brothers with a rolled up magazine for putting his feet on the table. More laughing. Just… intimidating but in the happiest way imaginable. I’ll admit I was a little shut down for a bit, but Mike kept checking in with me to make sure I was okay, and they were all really nice, so I got into the spirit after a bit.

I mentioned this in another comment, but Mike has a special sports wheelchair he uses for, well, sports. And he and his siblings play basketball. And he is GOOD. Apart from just having a hell of an arm, he’s quick as hell. And this magnificent bastard that I love will absolutely, purposefully, GLEEFULLY run someone’s toes over. He AIMS for it. They all have this yank-back-the-foot maneuver that’s hysterical to watch.

So it was this crazy day of loud people playing and having a blast, nieces and nephews running around, and just noise. My ears are still ringing. The food was catered in advance because his mom “had seven babies, all I make on mother’s day is margaritas.” They also have a pool, it’s a bit chilly still but the pool is HEATED so we actually all got to swim, which was a lot of fun because I got to show off that I too am athletic…. I can do a backwards somersault off a diving board! Yeah. I’m a real catch lol. They at least pretended to be impressed.

We all stayed up late drinking and bitching that it was too overcast to see the aurora (boo) and I had the worst hangover I’ve had in a while on Sunday. We slept in a bit late, and then joined Mike’s family for the BBQ part of the BBQ weekend. His dad can GRILL, people. And he’s fast, food coming off the grill at lightning speed. I asked Mike about it and he laughed and said “there was seven of us to feed. Ever see a nest of baby birds? He had practice.” Which, fair enough.

I don’t have much experience with babies, but I got to hold his youngest niece (the one living at home with his sis until her husband gets back from deployment) and we had a light talk about kids in the future. I told him that I never put much thought into it but if they were going to grow up in a happy home like his and not how I grew up, I’m pretty sure I’d be open to having them with him someday. But later. I need him all to myself for a while first. He seemed really really happy about that, which makes ME feel all goofy and happy. I’m sappy.

We had to drive home Sunday night, but before we went his mom hugged me and said she’s NEVER seen her son like this, and thanked me for taking good care of her baby. And asked if we’d be back for the 4th of July or if we were doing something with my family. And I tried to be all “haaaa no we’ll be here if you don’t mind, I don’t see them much” and I think she caught on that there’s more to the story so she just hugged the shit out of me (vikings, all of them I swear) and told me she can’t wait to see me again.

My ears are still ringing from all the noise and chaos, but it was an absolute blast and I can’t wait to see them again in July. Also, pretty much sure Mike is the man I’m going to marry. I literally can’t think of a single reason why I would ever let him get away.

Anyway thanks for reading, hope you all had a lovely weekend, and those of you who got to see the aurora I’m happy for you but you suck, lol.

UPDATE (again) Dating a disabled guy: 4th of July - July 6, 2024 As I’ve gotten a ton of requests for updates, I figured I would let you guys know how things are going in my world. You know how sometimes a relationship looks amazing at first but then all the red flags start showing up?

This isn’t one of those stories, lol.

Sorry, that was mean, but I couldn’t resist. Okay, on to the actual update! No we aren’t engaged yet. Yes we have talked about it in the context of how seriously we are taking things. No babies yet either obviously, we are diligent about birth control. I want Mike all to myself for a while.

So, the 4th of July visit to his family’s house was pretty awesome. After getting to know everyone last time I had better expectations of what I was going into, and I’ve talked with my therapist about the whole “play fighting makes me anxious because in my childhood home it wasn’t playing” thing. I don’t want them to ever curb how they act to cater to me, and instead I guess I’ll consider it immersion therapy. I think Mike mentioned it anyway because I didn’t see much of it this time, though there were cheerful threats of doom lobbed about which I didn’t mind at all.

His mom is amazing, I’d like to point out. Even if she moms so hard it makes me weepy. So, background info: I have a really common sounding name spelled REALLY uncommonly. Think Danyell or Jessikah. Because in addition to everything else my parents decided to be creative when they named me. So, although I do sort of like my name, that meant I was that kid who never saw their name personalized on anything. Mike’s family, on the other hand, had like a million kids and they all got traditional names, so personalized stuff was huge for them (it kept them from fighting over stuff I guess.) One of the things in their house, because they have a pool, is that each of the kids (adults now) has their own personalized beach towel that lives at the house.

So we get to their place and it’s been a hot drive there, so right after we get in Mike suggests I go to his room to get changed into a swimsuit so we can have a dip in the pool. I’m thinking that sounds perfect, right? Some of you may already know where this is going…. I get to his room and there is a towel on the bed. In my favorite color. With my fucking stupid-ass-spelled name embroidered into it. So here I am crying over a goddamn towel and he’s in the doorway watching and grinning like he just pranked me or some shit. Turns out it was HER idea but she checked with Mike to make sure it was spelled right. So now I have a towel for when we visit because APPARENTLY I’m welcome.

If I sound cranky it’s just because I’m better at self-depreciation than I am expressing emotions in a direct way. I really am blown away and touched by how much these people have welcomed me. Mike has already sort of learned to decode the way I talk and joke, which is nice, but the first time he gently said “that’s not humor, that’s just putting yourself down, babe,” I definitely wanted to go hide under the table. He doesn’t let me be mean to me. That’s a thing good partners do, I guess? I wouldn’t know. (Again, yes I am in therapy, I am working on myself, it’s not his responsibility to put me back together, it’s just something he does naturally.) I literally told him one night that I was sorry I’m kind of broken, and he snorted and said “at least you can walk” in the most disgusted voice ever and made me laugh.

I digress. So the food was once again amazing, and I kept my promise to teach his mom how to make my cinnamon bun bread pudding, so I felt like I contributed. (Insert Ralph Wiggum “I’m Helping!” meme.) I learned to play Yahtzee, and as it turns out I am very good at it. They do a lot of board games things at night when everyone is staying for the week. These people have a LOT of board games. And puzzles. Whole damn storage closet of the things. They also drink like fuckin FISH and can hold it so I am learning to pace myself. Mike doesn’t drink much when we aren’t there so I’m not worried that it’s a red flag. Only red flag of his that I’ve found was a Red Sox pennant in his room.

Now I realize I might be talking him up a lot, but he isn’t perfect! He snores, he has a habit of arguing with people on the TV when they make stupid decisions, he sometimes starts talking about things I don’t understand and just goes and goes until he realizes he lost me like 15 minutes ago, and he is FASTIDIOUSLY tidy, which makes me feel guilty because I have bad habits to lose. I’m not used to “clutter means I can’t move through an area” but I’m really trying. I barely spend any time at my own place anymore, and we’re definitely looking to move in together sooner than later.

Yeah, so, not that much of an update, no one burned themselves on a firework or anything super exciting, I’m just in an ongoing relationship with a great guy who has a great family and things continue to look up for us. We head home tonight so we can spend some alone time Sunday. Hope everyone else had a safe and happy holiday!

Edit: My extremely unhealthy but delicious cinnamon bun bread pudding recipe:

So you take two pop tubes of Pillsbury cinnamon buns and bake them per the instructions, but reserve the icing. Then turn off the oven and leave them in there for another 10 minutes (you want them a little overbaked.) Cool, then chop them up into pretty big rough pieces. Use a 13 x 9 pan with high sides, and put like 1/2 stick of melted butter in there and coat the bottom and sides.

Preheat oven to 400. Whisk up 8 eggs with 1/4 cup of half and half or heavy cream, put the cinnamon bun chunks in the pan, and then pour over the egg and cream mixture. Get in there with your hands to spread it out and make sure the egg and cream is mostly or totally absorbed. You can add another egg if it looks too dry, eggs aren't always the same size lol.

Bake for 20ish minutes uncovered until it feels firm, then add the icing from the tubes all over the top and let it cool a bit till the icing is super runny.

It can be served hot as is or brought somewhere and reheated in an oven for a bit, but if you reheat it cover it so the icing doesn't dry out.

I debated just posting this on my own page, but shit , like a lot of people keep asking for more so I guess it doesn’t hurt to drop my post between “AITAH for literally killing someone” and “AITAH for meekly accepting my inlaw’s cruelty but asking if I may wash my wounds before they flog me again.”

This is not an exciting update. Not engaged. No babies on the way, not even freakishly tall ones like some of you are hexing me with. But…. Jess finally met Mike.

TLDR: Learning to read long posts is good for your attention span.

SORRY! I mean I’m not sorry, I feel compelled to open with a joke and I don’t know why. Anyway real TLDR she thinks he’s amazing, she thinks it is HYSTERICAL that I’m on tictok (I refuse to download it) and she is doing amazing. And our lives are moving forward together.

Jess and I have this friend, who I will call Meg and NOT TALULAH despite both Jess and Mike thinking would be hilarious. Meg was planning to have a birthday party, the big THREE OH, and she and Jess are close (and both presently single.) They chose a local bar with outside seating, and Jess did a “wait, lets check their accessibility” because I have been bitching to her for the last month. And lol and be-fucking-hold after calling the place, they didn’t have a ramp for the balcony/outside seating area.

As I have been told Jess said “nope I am meeting Mr. Throwra\_JessComeOn” and so they found another place that’s a damn hike from everyone. But it has a great outside area with accessibility. And THEN we got the invite. Through Facebook because we are all basic, I guess? And Mike was stoked because they have this awesome beer selection (full stop I hate hops sooooo). Then Meg told us that (no I am not using Talulah for the 15% of you going “oh but that was such a better name”) they chose it because Jess wanted Mike to feel welcome. So hats off to Jess for making the comeback impression of the century, I guess.

The birthday was fun, and silly, and everyone in my immediate friend group met Mike and loved him. Tons of laughter, everyone drank way too much, but fortunately we had enough heads up for a planned motel stay (why yes, I do own a UV flashlight, why do you ask?) so we and a bunch of other people didn’t drive home. We actually had brunch in the bar the next day, it was absolutely awesome and I am ruined for pancakes because FLUFFY.

Once again, I digress.

Jess and Mike hit it off and she told him literally *every* story I didn’t want her to over brunch, and it all was great apart from the persistent hangover. I crashed at Mike’s again. Annnnnnd then he asked what it would cost to break my lease, because he hates the mornings he wakes up and I’m not there. So the next upcoming week and a half or so is going to be insane while I pack up my whole damn life and shove half into a storage unit and the other half into his apartment, and then we’ll be living together.

I know it’s too soon. He does too. We’ve decided we’re idiots and just going for it. My landlord is a lady who is a bit on the older side and isn’t charging me for breaking the lease as long as I leave the place ready for a new renter, so I may respond to comments for a bit right away but expect a lot of silence for a while after.

True TLDR: Best friend made a good second impression, and I’m moving in with Mike ahead of schedule. I should be worried but I’m actually just really excited.

post,16 year old gang-raped by police forced to have an abortion -- an ER doctor confirmed and is receiving death threats [translation in post],2019-11-09 14:38:25," Translation of the [news article from Liberty Times](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/2972517) on 11/09: 

""Ever since the anti-extradition law amendment bill movement started, many civilians have been arrested by the Hong Kong police. Among them, many women claimed that they were sexually harassed or even assaulted by HK police. Yesterday, a piece of information came out that a 16-year-old teenager was gang-raped by the police while she was in police custody, got pregnant, and was forced to have an abortion and forced to remain silent. About this, an ER doctor working at the hospital confirmed on his Facebook page. He also claimed that complaints have been filed against him, and that he is receiving death threats.

A HK internet user [disclosed this scandal](https://lihkg.com/thread/1700885/page/1) on[ lihkg.com](http://lihkg.com/) yesterday (the 8th), stating that a young woman was arrested during one of the protests, and that while she was in police custody, she was raped by multiple police officers, and unfortunately got pregnant. This post also stated that she had an abortion surgery yesterday at the Elizabeth Hospital. According to this internet user, this incident has spread widely among the medical professionals; he/she also swore on his/her entire families’ lives that everything in the post was true.

Today, an ER doctor made a post on his Facebook page “[Dr. Ray’s Emergency Room Journey.](https://www.facebook.com/dr.ray.on.call/posts/1404352349705828)” He stated that he already knew about it last week, and now this news “is like a fire that can no longer be concealed by paper”. He said that he is not the person who made the post on[ lihkg.com](http://lihkg.com/), but he already had complaints filed and death threats made against him. “But I believe that even if I fall down, there will be thousands of my colleagues who will continue to blow this whistle, just like now”

In the end, he also pleaded people in Hong Kong to not surround the hospital, because the medical professionals are put in a tight spot, that they are not able to “open their mouths”. He called for people in Hong Kong to convert their anger into support for the victims. “Hospital is a place for reasons and is not a battleground; I hope everyone can share their opinions peacefully”

In this post, he also shared [another scandal-disclosing post](https://www.facebook.com/hasecretspage/posts/2458946840894022?__tn__=K-R). Besides stating what happened to this 16 year old teenage girl, this other post also stated that there are attorneys looking into this incident, DNA sample collected, and that an investigation is underway.”

post,Should I make a tutorial for advanced LTN?,2023-05-27 17:27:21,"After dozens of hours working with LTN I returned to common trains, but almost immediately I understood that I won't ever play factorio without this mode. The reason why I tried to work without LTN were many of times when damn trains returned to depots with cargo left and then ruined the whole production.

It took me a long time, but I've made a station that works properly and requests as many trains as needed (valid mainly for big distances) and doesn't make them leave the station with something in cargo. Same with providers and guys, if you want me to make a tutorial, please let me know. The best in it is that this blueprint works for trains with multiple wagons and can be expanded to as many wagons as you need.

I've already made an easier tutorial in Steam, check if you want, but this one can definitely be improved. Link:[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2977302133](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2977302133)

I thanked her for them but she interrupted and said, ""It'll make more sense when you open the next gift."" I opened it and it was an A4 size, black, leather book with the words, 'No Country for Old Men' lasered into the leather. I thought maybe she bought me a sketch journal and the used pens were supposed to be art supplies - which would have been a great gift. ""Open it,"" she said. I opened it and the pages were filled. I thought maybe she wrote me several notes, or that maybe she passed the book around to friends to have them write a birthday note.

post,Struggling to scale our vanilla LTN-style train network (wagon length + tile space issue),2025-10-24 17:16:43,"Hey everyone,

https://preview.redd.it/hfyzyrf0t2xf1.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d18de9a235e932bb381c897c56befc1334aa7959

me and my friend have been building a rail-based city in Factorio, and our entire logistics system runs on a vanilla version of LTN using the “new” interrupt system. Basically, trains automatically detect which resource is needed in the network, and the first available train goes to a Provider station, then unloads at a Requester station. It’s been working super smoothly so far… but now we’ve hit a couple of big issues.



Problem #1: Handling different train lengthsIf a station needs a train with 2+ wagons, we can’t find a way to communicate that to the depot system. Is there any way to send a signal through the network that says, “I need a train with two (or more) wagons”? We want to keep things scalable, so manually assigning trains or setting up fixed routes isn’t really an option.

Our current workaround. We made all trains 4 wagons long. Then we set up a system that communicates esource demand per wagon. e.g.1 wagon = 4k iron plates; 2 wagons = 8k etc. That way, every station can technically host a 4-wagon train, but depending on how the station is configured, it will only load/unload 1–4 wagons. For example: A plastic provider/requester usually handles just 1 wagon (since demand never gets too high). Iron plate stations often handle 3–4 wagons This works fine logically, but…

https://preview.redd.it/evr9aci4t2xf1.png?width=833&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=143d07609192efa236bf39cdd7b74f6caf275cd3



Problem #2 — Space and tile layout: Now every station needs to fit a 4-wagon train. We’re using 100x100 tiles, and we just can’t find a way to fit all the stations (including train stackers) within that area.Even worse, for tiles where multiple resources are both produced and requested (4–5 resources per tile), there’s simply no way to fit everything — loaders, unloaders, stackers, and all — without spilling onto the main rail lines.

[OLD System](https://preview.redd.it/ntx87occt2xf1.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9f17252429722e916a9ed502d614a1e45c6687d)

Our question is: How can we design a layout that fits loading/unloading rails and a small stacker area within a 100x100 tile, without blocking the main network? Any advice, screenshots, or blueprint examples would be massively appreciated! We really want to keep the setup compact and scalable without having to break our vanilla “LTN-like” logic.",21.0,https://www.reddit.com/search.json/r/factorio/comments/1of0hvn/struggling_to_scale_our_vanilla_ltnstyle_train/,LTN,,Yes

In my experience in the US, smaller airports are less chaotic and easier to travel out of, but I have read that LTN is chaotic.

If you had the choice of flying out of LTN or LHR is there one you would prefer, or would you just go with schedule or airline as your main consideration if price is the same?
