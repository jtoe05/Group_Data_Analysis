post,How do you feel about Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in your borough?,2020-09-09 11:47:44,"So LTN's are popping up around London. 

The point is that they are supposed to reduce the dominance of cars in residential areas and allow journeys to be more easily made via cycling, walking and public transport. There are many places in London where they have existed for decades but it's argued that GPS, increasing numbers of cars, increasing numbers of cyclists and the need for physical distancing has made it more urgent.

However as a result some car journeys may be longer and there are claims that traffic and pollution is made worse on main roads - where people also live.

There is also large scale opposition from many black taxi drivers who are accustomed to using back streets to avoid traffic which may no longer be possible.

What's your view and it would be good to know how you travel around London?

post,Low Traffic Neighbourhood trials suspended - Wandsworth,2020-09-11 18:39:31,"Wandsworth Council is to suspend its Low Traffic Neighbourhood (LTN) trials following a high level review.

The LTN trials were introduced last month to make residential streets more bike and pedestrian friendly and to deter rat run traffic.  


They were part of a series of measures introduced as part of the COVID response by freeing up additional space on the highway in support of social distancing and to promote alternative forms of travel as people gradually return to work.

The trials also supported the council’s ambition of combating climate change by encouraging people to use more sustainable forms of transport and tackling air quality.

However an initial review of the trials has identified concerns with emergency access and traffic flows. And this has been compounded by additional changes that Transport for London (TfL) is making to red route roads in the borough.  


These include significant interventions on the A24 (Balham High Road to Tooting High Street and beyond) including moving bus stops, installing cycle lane segregation, banning turns at a number of junctions and removing parking.

The scale of these A24 changes coinciding with the council’s efforts to establish LTNs on residential streets has caused confusion and long traffic queues.

Additionally, concerns around rising COVID rates and reduced capacity on public transport has meant that alternative travel options are limited for many people at this time.

In light of these initial trial findings the council has decided to suspend the LTN trials.

Wandsworth Council’s cabinet member for strategic planning and transportation, Cllr John Locker said: “We have monitored the traffic flows and listened to feedback from residents and businesses. We have also spoken to our partners including local hospitals and key services to hear the impact on them.

“It is clear that the LTNs are not delivering the benefits we want to see. In fact it looks like the combination of changes in areas like Tooting, where TfL are making changes to the main high road, are unfortunately having the opposite effect. That is why we have taken the difficult decision to pause and re-think about how we can achieve our objective of delivering healthier, safer streets.”

He added: “We all want to do what is right environmentally, whilst maintaining people’s ability to travel and making sure town centres and high streets function properly. It’s important that we listen to what people are saying so that we get this right.”

The Council will continue to review the impact of TfL’s road changes to the A24 in Balham and Tooting to see if the issues improve over the coming weeks.

comment,,2020-09-12 10:53:03,"It's easy to get consultation responses from noisy minorities. Motorists and cyclists can sometimes indentify very strongly with their mode of transport. Pedestrians? Not so much. Children who can't safely walk to school, who can't play in their street, are they going to up and form a local campaigning organisation to represent their interests? Of course not. But they are hugely affected by the dominance of motor traffic.

I do think that it's up to councils to weather any initial angry response and show leadership - particularly if they were elected on manifestos which stated they would encourage walking and cycling. They shouldn't judge the response by how busy their inbox is now, but by how busy it is once everyone has got used to the changes. I bet councillors in Hackney never get emails asking them to rip out bollards put in place back in the 70s, put it that way...

The way it's been implemented is a disaster. All they needed to do was make the roads a dead end either at one end or in the middle of the road and it would have the same effect in reducing all through traffic which is the problem. There are thousands of these all around london for years that work absolutely fine.

You wouldn't get people getting fined because it's impossible to read the fucking signs, and residents can still access the road and a few local people could still go and park on the road if they needed to, or you know visit a friend who lives on the road, or pick their nan up in their car to take her to the shops, and you could still put your benches and stuff up. 

And you wouldn't even get anti green car users protesting ""green zones"". it would just be another dead end road, end of story.

comment,,2021-06-03 12:05:02,"I'm an LTN supporter but some of the ""evidence"" in the early part of that article was thin at best.

You can't divine from ward voting patterns of Con v Lab whether people supported an LTN or not. That's ridiculous given what is going on in national politics and the fact that both Shaun Bailey and Sadiq Khan are, in their own ways, divisive candidates. Even in somewhere where LTNs were a big issue like Ealing and where even some Labour politicians like Rupa Huq came out as anti LTN.

About the best one can conclude is that they aren't a major vote loser.

Once it became clear that Shaun Bailey would lose it was a slam dunk on for Labour pro-cycling types to treat the elections as a referendum on LTNs. Arguably, for a candidate as poor as Bailey, his improved showing in polls, which was higher than predicted, could equally be attributed to his anti-LTN stance.

""LTNs block roads""  

Her evidence for that is a taxi driver complaining about it to her. There's no evidence for that at all. Roads have been busier, but it's due to more drivers as people avoid public transport (as shown [in Sustrans' overview of LTN research](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/for-professionals/infrastructure/an-introductory-guide-to-low-traffic-neighbourhood-design/an-introductory-guide-to-low-traffic-neighbourhood-design-contents/design-guide/all/5-a-guide-to-the-evidence-around-low-traffic-neighbourhoods).  

""They prevent injuries, but that's not important as it's obvious"" 

I really don't understand that argument. Is it even an argument?  

""They generate too many fines""  

Good. People should pay attention to road signs. Whether that's LTN signs or 20mph speed limits or whatever else.  

""It's bad because the Conservatives are now investing money in active travel""  

Another one I really don't understand.

People are still avoiding public transport, so traffic is higher than it was pre-pandemic. I hope this changes soon, the risk doesn't seem very high what with how many people are vaccinated and mask wearing still being mandatory. Plus TfL badly needs the money from fares of course.

The consultations for the most part were hampered by the need to move quickly.

I think sometimes the main road route will be slower, but more reliable.

comment,,2024-03-28 15:00:34,"Not read about them since they came out but yeah I remember you still need a moped or normal driving license so either way you have to do the theory and practical even though it only tops out at 28mph.I guess getting hit at 28mph by a 500kg object can still kill someone and you need to know all the rules so why not. I also remember them being quite expensive for what they are though, pretty sure they were like £9-10k.

They're a bit smaller than the small smart cars. Maybe a 30cm ruler length shorter and narrower. If Smart cars aren't taking off and they can be used on any roads and go the national speed limit then I don't think these things will.

They seem to be a bit of a weird inbetween car. Like if you need a full license and it's costing £10,000 then at least have it go 45mph or so because then it'll definitely be good for even outer london too at that speed. They can be had for cheap monthly, maybe thats the selling point.

Either way tiny cars aren't going to take off unless we tax cars based on size, and maybe set parking based on size like Paris recently did. Until then for some reason people will continue buying bigger and bigger cars even though a seat is a seat and almost nobody needs the extra cargo space. Have like 5 bands of car tax based on size and weight and have the biggest be around double the current rates and the smallest around half the current rates. Only then will people maybe think about getting smaller cars. Or ideally if supermarkets and other places started putting just a couple/few mini spaces near the entrances for cars like this then they'll take off like crazy imo. Would be awesome driving straight to the front to get an easy spot every time, plus the supermarket will fit more spaces, everyone wins including pedestrians, cyclists, and the environment.

Edit: Fullycharged just did a video on a budget alternative to this car, the video has them testing it in London. Only £6k but it's very stripped back and basic, same speed and license needed and stuff.

Just remembered they did a video on what actually is the perfect London car though. It's similar size to the OP car and is called the Silence S04 and is also good quality looking. Selling point is that it has 2 batteries that slide in under the seat which each slide out and has trolly wheels, they look just like a small suitcase. You then just wheel the small suitcase into your house and charge it there. So it even solves any charging issues that comes with having no off street parking. It also has a max speed of 55mph so it can hold up on any London road, no need to avoid 50-60mph roads like I would if I was using the 28mph max speed cars. It costs £15,000 though but honestly it's perfect and solves all the issues the oriignal post car has. Easily worth the extra £5k. Heres the video on it.

post,Should all of central London become one giant LTN?,2025-06-05 17:52:17,"I’m 100% serious. 

Central London is completely and utterly overstuffed with vehicles, and it’s a nightmare to travel through at the best of times - and that’s to say nothing about the pollution and lung destruction caused, the completely unnecessary traffic deaths, and the insane noise and stress that comes from just being exposed to that.

LTNs and pedestrianised zones are a *literal* breath of fresh air - no more having to worry about getting crushed by a speeding two tonne steel Kevin- or Karen-mobile.

Plus, without personal automobiles, there would be SO much more room for cyclists, which would also mean more room for pedestrians as we could expand the pavements.

Remember, cycling is a the most popular form of transportation in London now, the one least likely to cause the death of fellow road users. 

Clearly, there will need to be exceptions - blue badge holders, emergency vehicles and the like. Busses too, but even those would benefit since there would be virtually zero other traffic to contend with. Delivery drivers could be allowed only outside of peak hours (before 8am, let’s say)

Just the other day in my area, a driver was speeding at 40mph in a 20mph main road, and careened around a corner and hit another car and crushed 3 pedestrians agains the shopfront he ran them into. The paramedics had to literally salt the road to prevent the bloodstains from soaking in. 

I don’t  mean to be graphic, but this is the reality of living in a city congested with cars. 

So why not make it virtually impossible to drive one unless for the aforementioned exceptional circumstances?

Why keep allowing cars to take the piss?

EDIT: pedestrianisation would likely cause an economic boom amongst small businesses in those areas it was implemented as your footfall would be so much higher

&gt; In 2021 we received a petition to ‘restrict rat running’ in the West Ham Park area, so we looked into the traffic data and found that half of the traffic in the area was not local, but rather, traffic using the neighbourhood as a shortcut. We looked into road safety statistics and found that there was on average, a casualty every 15 days over a four-year period.

&gt; The use of enforcement cameras and issuing fines is to prevent motor vehicles from driving through modal filters whilst allowing exempted motor vehicles to drive through. The main alternative to camera enforcement would be moveable gates or bollards, but consultation with police, fire and ambulance services shows this is not their preferred option and barriers would slow down their vehicles when every second counts in an emergency.

&gt; In Newham’s other LTNs, four of the five LTNs experienced a reduction in boundary road traffic by the end of the experimental scheme. There is also research from University of Westminster which monitored the 46 most recent LTN schemes in London and found that there was little change in boundary road traffic.

comment,,2021-03-02 18:17:58,"Cycling is still weighted towards men and particularly white men. No shit though - until recently, cycling was more like a bloodsport in London. It was actively hostile to slow and unconfident cyclists. It still is. I get a proper old skool close pass maybe once a week now but it's enough to put you off.

I started cycling in London when literally the only people who commuted were bike freaks, couriers, sandal wearers and a minority of lycra'ed up club guys. People used to look at you slack jawed if you told them you cycled across London.

Some years after I started cycling in London I remember joining a mass bike ride to protest a lethal section of road that was notorious for cycle fatalities. This was maybe 2 years after the first cycle superhighways were put in and they were still basically just some blue paint on the road. Cycling commuters were *still* a tiny minority. In my organisation of 500 maybe 10 people cycled in. We had a dedicated bike storage, showers etc.

Anyway it's funny when cabbies call cycling race/class exclusive. Sure, mate. I can count the number of ethnic minority black cab drivers I've seen on one hand.

comment,,2023-10-21 13:12:21,"I'm in the hinterland between Camberwell and Brixton but not the Loughborough Junction bit.  Even Estate Agents are unsure whether to call it Camberwell, Brixton or Loughborough Junction and it's not trendy enough to call 'Vibrant'.  I once saw it called Stockwell but that was a mighty stretch. Like calling Peckham Dulwich.

I was born in 1955 and have lived locally all my born days. The area has changed a lot since the 1980s. There was a thriving, if not hugely lucrative local economy but also grinding poverty, loads of WW2 bomb-sites, crumbling Victorian blocks of big, once grand houses converted into shitty bedsits with shared stoves and inadequate toilets on the landings (I was told the very worst were owned by greedy evil twins but whether the Barclay brothers or the Krays, I couldn't tell you). 

There's a network of Victorian railway viaducts which once had lots of small businesses in the arches. Fruit wholesalers, mechanics, stabled ponies, rag merchants, market traders, all sorts. The arches look swanky and uniform and have been refurbished with shiny shutters replacing the big old wooden doors. Many are unoccupied, the rents are now ridiculous. Since gentrification lots of people have been pushed out and priced out and many useful shops and businesses have been replaced with bars and trendy food places. The strong communities that remain are the Estates. The Council ones I mean, not the gated communities like the one built where the best local comprehensive school was deliberately run down, sold and demolished. 

In some ways gentrification has shut down opportunities for the less well-heeled but now there's a big shortage of reliable dog-walkers, childcare and charladies. I'd never move away despite being sad at who and what's gone. I've watched people go to school together, get married, have kids, have grandchildren. I am rooted here. People know me and I know them. We look out for each other. I didn't work further away than I could walk to until I was nearly 50 (I did take a bus on rainy days). Local work gradually got scarcer, less varied. One thing London has lost is small manufacturers. There were even a few larger factories eg R. Whites lemonade in Camberwell. One of my great-aunts worked her whole life at Price's candle factory in Vauxhall. She used to boast she'd made the candles for the Coronation and the family joke was 'Which one?' 

The thing I do really like is we have horses and ponies again. There used to be loads. Some belonged to Gypsies and Travellers, some for rag &amp; bone, small commercial traders who loved their horses and kept one or two although they mostly drove about in Commer vans. The arches were cheap to rent and lots of ponies were stabled in the arches. Eventually the only horses left were the police horses at Brixton. I loved hearing them at night slowly clip-clopping through the back roads to Brixton after football matches at Charlton or Millwall. It was sad when they left.

A small local kids charity run out of a kitchen took kids kayaking, riding, to the seaside or whatever, things they would never normally get to do. They raised enough money to open a riding charity.

They just need to put the squeeze on people and either ban private cars outright apart from exceptional circumstances, or just make owning a car in London a completely joyless experience. Have an approved list of vehicles, require a yearly license for ownership and pedestrianise or ban private vehicles from vast swathes of the roads.

comment,,2020-07-08 12:04:09,"The new flats on the high street are quiet and well insulated. This is great in the winter as you'll be nice and warm but poses two problems in the summer (even with this year's feeble attempt at summer).

1. The flats quickly heat up to an uncomfortable temperature.

2. When you open the windows it is very very noise unless you are 7 or 8 floors up. There's a lot of traffic from emergency vehicles getting through East London. Also the high street is wide and straight, a favourite for racers. Maybe once every couple months someone will wrap their Audi around a traffic sign.






East village, by the trains is similar to the high street but there is constant low level noise. When commuter trains stop, you'll still have engineering works and goods trains.

East village, around the park is very quiet, you'll get the odd ambulance but that's about it. Emergent service vehicles won't drive through East village unless there is an incident in East village. It's faster for them to go around.



East village on the edge of Elizabeth park is  better than the high street if you can afford it. It is quieter, local shops and closer to the main train /tube/bus connections. You have the park, not too far from Victoria park and a canal to walk along. It has a faux sanatised community feel about it and overall doesn't have any edginess.
