comment,,2020-10-22 16:39:20,"Well I had a look at some recent studies and they don't support the claim that LTN's decrease overall traffic use on surrounding roads, mainly because they didn't study it (??? very strange, is that because it might make the scheme look bad? I hope not but suspicious imo).

There's evidence that people self report cycling and walking more, but it doesn't seem to be massively statistically pronounced.

I may have sounded like I am against any and all traffic reduction schemes, but this is not the case. I do think it's a good idea, but I think if you're going to direct all traffic down a main road away from rat runs then you should also consider adding an extra lane to that road or other upgrades.

I don't think simply increasing journey times is a very good strategy, I think it should be attacked the other way by making it easier to use other forms of travel and just mainly leaving the car the fuck alone. 

Now I know London is a bit different, most of my thinking is how these kind of schemes have been implemented where I live, they have closed several key bridges to prevent 'rat runs' and it has made the traffic worse on the main roads, no doubt about it.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/jfvcru/despite_a_loud_opposing_minority_lowtraffic/g9ng6ul/,,"Despite a loud opposing minority, low-traffic neighbourhoods are increasingly popular.

The worst part is the first 6 months, as the congestion goes up, and local cunts go on social media wanking on about congestion like it never existed before (spoiler alert: it did). We had protests of around 50 people down to 2, over a few months.

Anyway, the trial period is over, and the filters are permanent now. Main roads are busier during peak time, quieter the rest of the time. I see way more people with bikes, especially bakfiets. So so many roads made peaceful.

comment,,2025-05-18 08:49:20,"I work for the construction arm of a council. An incredible amount of time, cost and programme delay happens from consultations, and I guess like the article is saying, it's vague whether the councillors/client have to pay any attention to the consultation results anyway, if they believe the consultee's points aren't valid.


There's so many flaws in the system it would take me a long time to type them out here, but one is that you only have to let people know about the consultation in the area you're consulting on, so something that would benefit the area at large would always be objected to.


Also we normally get about 10 consultation responses for large villages/small towns with a few thousand people in despite all the advertisement - if people like or are indifferent to schemes they often won't respond.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1kkdt4u/lowtraffic_neighbourhood_scheme_ruled_unlawful_in/msx16t5/,,Low-traffic neighbourhood scheme ruled unlawful in landmark decision,No

Based on comparisons of more than a decade of road casualty statistics between 113 London LTNs and other roads that did not have them, the report’s authors found that LTNs were associated with a 35% reduction in all injuries, rising to 37% for deaths and serious injuries.

In absolute terms, the study concluded, this meant that creating the LTNs prevented more than 600 road injuries that would have otherwise taken place, including 100 involving death or serious injury.

My own council in London did their consultation on parking permits on my road incorrectly. Instead of doubling down and forcing it through, they repeated the consultation so did it correctly the second time. The result was the same. It probably helped that a councillor lived off the road so knew some of the residents who wouldn't hesitate to take the council to court.


I recently had an issue with another London council. It's gone on for a few years.

So I think it is a useful exercise to first simply imagine what you think happened in this case, based purely on the headline and your general vibes.

post,My latest Low-Traffic neighbourhood,2025-09-16 23:41:42,"I just converted another area of my city into an LTN, to create a cycling and walking safe neighbourhood. I've attached some stills of the improvements. I upgraded the main road to include a segregated cycle lane.

I then placed some modal filters at some junctions (and other strategic points), to allow only cycles and pedestrians through. This should hopefully reduce traffic in this area, as it has in all my other LTNs.

I also replaced a vehicle bridge with two separate cycle and pedestrian bridges (last image)

How did I do? What other improvements can I make city-wide to help cyclists and pedestrians? How else can I improve my LTNs?

P.S. bus services are still running normally through this LTN, and are servicing the area well, without any significant delays. In fact, the reduced traffic from the LTN will hopefully \*increase\* bus timings.

That's the judgement. The case is, as usual, being made out to be something it isn't. This is not some ruling about the merits or not of LTNs, but about whether this specific council competently complied with the statutory consultation requirements. (They didn't.)

Of course most LTN opposition is from conspiracy nuts and right-wing loons, but UK councils are commonly incompetent, and so are quite capable of either buggering up LTNs so badly that the (unquestionable) benefits are minimised and the disadvantages maximised, or of imposing obviously-bad LTNs for local political reasons\*. This ruling has nothing to say about the merits of this particular LTN, though when a council is incompetent enough to mess up the statutory consultation, I have no confidence that they will have come up with a good LTN scheme. 

\*I am not familiar with every LTN in London, by any means, but out of the fairly limited number I've seen, most are quite well designed, and two are frankly dreadful: one has taken all the traffic from a number of wealthy roads, to the benefit of wealthy homeowners, and shoved it onto roads running past schools predominantly used by the poorer parts of the community; another seems to be pretty blatantly designed to stop poor people going to or through a rich area, with a ridiculous time-cost to the residents of the LTN due to the only entries and exits being on a very congested stretch of dual carriageway, permitting travel in only one direction, with no sensible way to go in the other direction.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1kis29q/west_dulwich_lowtraffic_neighbourhood_ltn/mrhjd5u/,,"West Dulwich low-traffic neighbourhood (LTN) unlawful, High Court rules",No

What I will say, specifically linked to this post, is that the likes of the West Dulwich Action Group aren’t actually looking for the nuance you are alluding to (by the way I never implied that the matter isn’t nuanced). Going through the trouble of taking an entire council to court kind of gives away your intentions. 

London remains a heavily car-centric city as a whole and this is not sustainable according to any metrics (costs, emissions, air quality, or safety).

post,Hanover low traffic area,2022-09-02 17:42:29,"Has anyone else had the nonsense, misleading, appeal to ignorance flyer through their door suggesting that the low traffic neighbourhood is bad for the environment? 

I'm really enraged to be honest. The first attempt at one in the city, with actually really limited changes to the traffic flow, on roads that I cycle on and get forced to stop because ""Mr look how big my balls are"" in his car or van has to prove a point. (Even though council tax pays for roads). 

It's so sad that this presumably funded pro-car-flyer has been distributed to encourage people to ""stop the forced LTN"" that will supposedly ""destroy Hanover"" has been circulated and I worry that it will lead to lots of car owners leaving feedback and lots of non car users, pedestrians, cyclists... Parents... Not actually leaving positive feedback. 

A low traffic neighbourhood will be better for people with sensory disabilities, those that cycle and can commute to work or to the station via bike without the worry of for example half asleep drivers blasting their horn at you as they speed down a side street, for those with kids who want to stretch their legs without the constant flow of traffic. The entire point is that cars can still get to their location via a road that is built to sustain the volume of traffic. For example where is there traffic lights and crossings in Hanover? I have also done some simple searches and the idea that the traffic will continue to be higher of the routes around Hanover is debunked, people in low traffic neighbourhoods tend to embrace the change and abandon their car (to some extent)

Ultimately are you in favour of trying and maybe failing, or are you in favour of not trying and sticking with business as usual, all the while having unsafe streets for those who choose to cycle and pedestrians, having increased air pollution, increased noise pollution particularly at night with cars who have no business being in the side streets?

comment,,2024-11-26 21:30:10,"&gt;  radical plan

Doesn't have to be radical. It can be a slow change. 

&gt; I've lived in London and honestly it's a genius idea. Lots of winding, narrow streets and roads are a pain to drive through but perfect to bike on. I wonder how feasible it is to design a network in NYC?

You have to remember that European towns and cities are old, it's easy to turn those small roads that are not accessible to cars into paths for bikes. In the US, cities are built around the idea of cars. 

NYC is progressing well in many ways about being more bike-centric but it takes a lot of work. When the [34th Open Streets](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/34th-ave-open-street-cb3-full-board-oct2021.pdf) was first put into place, there were lots of angry car folks in a lot of the town hall meetings who opposed it. And it took volunteers to make it happen, a bunch of us put the metal barriers in place in the morning and set them aside at night before the city had a budget to hire people. 

Be active in your community. Report issues! While 99% of the time, the police precinct will close a ticket without any kind of investigation, that 1% when they take action does a lot more good than all posting on this sub complaining about it.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCbike/comments/1h0ik6u/are_london_approaches_cycle_quietway_network_and/lz4rxxy/,,Are London approaches (Cycle Quietway network and Low Traffic Neighborhood) feasible in NYC?,No
comment,,2024-11-27 13:49:13,"For me, one of the things that made cycling in London so easy was the lack of parking. I could ride close the curb even in heavy traffic areas. 

The feeling of a cycle quiet way already happens in some small pockets in NYC, those that have winding streets or dead ends nearby. 

An interesting example of a model that could be used to replicate this is the closed street in the 90s on the east side. I forget the specific street, but it's a crosstown lane closed to traffic for one block. With this small closure, the rest of the street is naturally quieter because it's not used for through traffic. 

This is to say that you don't need a complete open street like Berry Street in order to create calmer traffic conditions.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCbike/comments/1h0ik6u/are_london_approaches_cycle_quietway_network_and/lz8gby0/,,Are London approaches (Cycle Quietway network and Low Traffic Neighborhood) feasible in NYC?,No

post,Inuit residential care centre Larga Baffin faces angry opposition from councillor Diane Deans,2022-04-27 14:17:46,"I had the extreme displeasure of attending a public information session last night on the Larga Baffin proposal on Hunt Club road.

Larga Baffin is a Inuit owned residential care centre for people travelling from Nunavut to Ottawa for emergency medical care unavailable at home, including treatment for cancer and heart disease. Nunavut only has one hospital and they have a huge nursing shortage and low capacity to deal with the medical concerns of residents, so they often fly to Ottawa for care.

Larga Baffin have spent the past 6 years searching for suitable property for a new building. They are currently located on Richmond Road but they are far from hospitals and the airport, and they have to overflow clients to nearby hotels because they don't have enough space. The new proposed location is much closer to the airport and medical facilities, and it's a designed community to support the people travelling for care, rather than an old retrofitted building like where they currently are.

I personally met with Diane Deans on this proposal a couple months, because I saw her opposition to it based on ""traffic"" and ""size"" and ""greenspace"" — the usual NIMBY red flags.

She literally told me that she was concerned it was going to be like the Salvation Army build in Vanier and she was worried that it was going to lead to Indigenous homeless people flooding her neighbourhood.

Keep in mind this is a sitting city councillor who is running for mayor... I was absolutely aghast then, and I still am.

I sat in on the public meeting last night and could not believe the anger and hostility from local residents, whipped into a fury by their city councillor.

Now, she publicly has reverted to claiming that the project is ""grossly oversized"" (the surrounding area is zoned for 6 storey and 9 storey builds — this is a 6 storey proposal) and she is concerned about a huge traffic impact (Hunt Club is a major arterial road, none of these people are bringing cars from Nunavut, and they have medical shuttles to get to and from appointments that serve the community).

Some of the comments at the public meeting were incredibly gross — people asked about the amount of crime this facility would bring, or how we could keep these people out of their local parks — but I wanted to highlight one in particular, which best summarizes the privilege and lack of self-awareness demonstrated by the NIMBY group angry about this project.

[https://twitter.com/DeanTester/status/1519139010324664322](https://twitter.com/DeanTester/status/1519139010324664322)

""I spent a lot of money on this house... WE ARE HERE FIRST!""

I cannot imagine how ignorant a person would have to be to tell a group of Inuit people to stay out of the neighbourhood because you think you were there first... but that's where we're at. Unfortunately, there were 250+ people on this Zoom call last night, and almost all of them were just this angry about the proposal.

If you're like me, you probably don't think that a small group of angry, wealthy homeowners, who only care about their property value, should be able to block a residential care home for desperate Inuit people, here's what you can do:

1. Tweet at dianedeans on Twitter or email her at [diane.deans@ottawa.ca](mailto:diane.deans@ottawa.ca) and let her know you want to see Larga Baffin get their new build as soon as possible, so the Inuit community can receive the world class medical care they deserve.
2. Send your feedback to the City of Ottawa through the DevApps portal — let them know you support this project! [https://devapps.ottawa.ca/en/applications/D01-01-21-0022/details](https://devapps.ottawa.ca/en/applications/D01-01-21-0022/details)
3. Email, call, or tag on social media the chairs of the planning committee — Scott Moffat and Glen Gower — and contact the other members as well, urging them to ignore the NIMBY campaign and approve this project: [https://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/council-committees-and-boards/committees-and-boards/planning-committee](https://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/council-committees-and-boards/committees-and-boards/planning-committee)

post,Vent: Townhouse suburbs suck,2025-08-23 01:28:22,"I live in a townhouse, and absolutely hate it. I didn't think it would be this bad when moving in, especially considering we picked one specifically without an HOA. I was wrong.

It's so overstimulating. Every single day at least one of my 300 neighbours is getting something done to their home. Someone is always mowing a lawn, cutting down the one tree in their front yard, or getting their roof worked on. How are there construction crew trucks here every single day?? For the low low price of $500k (250 in 2021 when purchased), you too can live in a home where you don't get a single moment of peace. There's a loud car alarm going off every single day, kids are outside screaming 24/7, loud truck engines with no muffler at 5 in the morning. To top it all off, expect to never find a spot to park in front of your own if there's a holiday. 

I had to park my car almost half a block from my house on Mother's day. Honestly maybe I'd understand if it was an apartment complex you're renting at, but when you're paying $500k + property taxes + maintenance + bills I would at least like a parking spot. The streets are so narrow so when you're K-turning from the curb you can expect to be in an almost head on collision with another car going straight down that comes out of nowhere, driving the neighbourhood street at 35mph. Usually a 10 foot tall pickup truck because you really need all that in the New Jersey suburbs as a dentist!!


You get all the downside of living in a city, but none of the benefits. Sure there's a lot of places to spend money. But what difference does it make if you're somewhere rural with one nearby diner/coffee shop, versus 20 Dunkins in the suburbs? There aren't many authentic family businesses, just 15 locations of a Target and Dollar tree. It's crowded AF but nothing is made walkable. You have to take your car everywhere, and if your drive is 2 miles expect it to be at least 20 minutes of you just sitting there in stand still traffic from all the car accidents. I'm done.

post,How do you feel about Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in your borough?,2020-09-09 11:47:44,"So LTN's are popping up around London. 

The point is that they are supposed to reduce the dominance of cars in residential areas and allow journeys to be more easily made via cycling, walking and public transport. There are many places in London where they have existed for decades but it's argued that GPS, increasing numbers of cars, increasing numbers of cyclists and the need for physical distancing has made it more urgent.

However as a result some car journeys may be longer and there are claims that traffic and pollution is made worse on main roads - where people also live.

There is also large scale opposition from many black taxi drivers who are accustomed to using back streets to avoid traffic which may no longer be possible.

What's your view and it would be good to know how you travel around London?

Since then I've seen Labour councillors and other Labour leaning people use the same kind of rhetoric. We have stoked the fire and are going to get our fingers burnt. Again.

Farage (and those like him) have been quick to jump on this bandwagon. Just like other parts of the 'culture wars' LTNs are wedge issues that can be used to emotionally garner support. Falling into line with their rhetoric will not give transfer the support to us - all it does is strengthen the support in the other direction. We should be bold in fighting back on these points, not just meekly repeating their stock phrases.

post,Low Traffic Neighbourhood trials suspended - Wandsworth,2020-09-11 18:39:31,"Wandsworth Council is to suspend its Low Traffic Neighbourhood (LTN) trials following a high level review.

The LTN trials were introduced last month to make residential streets more bike and pedestrian friendly and to deter rat run traffic.  


They were part of a series of measures introduced as part of the COVID response by freeing up additional space on the highway in support of social distancing and to promote alternative forms of travel as people gradually return to work.

The trials also supported the council’s ambition of combating climate change by encouraging people to use more sustainable forms of transport and tackling air quality.

However an initial review of the trials has identified concerns with emergency access and traffic flows. And this has been compounded by additional changes that Transport for London (TfL) is making to red route roads in the borough.  


These include significant interventions on the A24 (Balham High Road to Tooting High Street and beyond) including moving bus stops, installing cycle lane segregation, banning turns at a number of junctions and removing parking.

The scale of these A24 changes coinciding with the council’s efforts to establish LTNs on residential streets has caused confusion and long traffic queues.

Additionally, concerns around rising COVID rates and reduced capacity on public transport has meant that alternative travel options are limited for many people at this time.

In light of these initial trial findings the council has decided to suspend the LTN trials.

Wandsworth Council’s cabinet member for strategic planning and transportation, Cllr John Locker said: “We have monitored the traffic flows and listened to feedback from residents and businesses. We have also spoken to our partners including local hospitals and key services to hear the impact on them.

“It is clear that the LTNs are not delivering the benefits we want to see. In fact it looks like the combination of changes in areas like Tooting, where TfL are making changes to the main high road, are unfortunately having the opposite effect. That is why we have taken the difficult decision to pause and re-think about how we can achieve our objective of delivering healthier, safer streets.”

He added: “We all want to do what is right environmentally, whilst maintaining people’s ability to travel and making sure town centres and high streets function properly. It’s important that we listen to what people are saying so that we get this right.”

The Council will continue to review the impact of TfL’s road changes to the A24 in Balham and Tooting to see if the issues improve over the coming weeks.

comment,,2020-09-12 10:53:03,"It's easy to get consultation responses from noisy minorities. Motorists and cyclists can sometimes indentify very strongly with their mode of transport. Pedestrians? Not so much. Children who can't safely walk to school, who can't play in their street, are they going to up and form a local campaigning organisation to represent their interests? Of course not. But they are hugely affected by the dominance of motor traffic.

I do think that it's up to councils to weather any initial angry response and show leadership - particularly if they were elected on manifestos which stated they would encourage walking and cycling. They shouldn't judge the response by how busy their inbox is now, but by how busy it is once everyone has got used to the changes. I bet councillors in Hackney never get emails asking them to rip out bollards put in place back in the 70s, put it that way...

edit - re the mention of manifestos, [this snippet](https://twitter.com/Jo_Earlsfield/status/1304699461046882304) from the Wandsworth Tories' election material in 2018 is interesting.

post,Should all of central London become one giant LTN?,2025-06-05 17:52:17,"I’m 100% serious. 

Central London is completely and utterly overstuffed with vehicles, and it’s a nightmare to travel through at the best of times - and that’s to say nothing about the pollution and lung destruction caused, the completely unnecessary traffic deaths, and the insane noise and stress that comes from just being exposed to that.

LTNs and pedestrianised zones are a *literal* breath of fresh air - no more having to worry about getting crushed by a speeding two tonne steel Kevin- or Karen-mobile.

Plus, without personal automobiles, there would be SO much more room for cyclists, which would also mean more room for pedestrians as we could expand the pavements.

Remember, cycling is a the most popular form of transportation in London now, the one least likely to cause the death of fellow road users. 

Clearly, there will need to be exceptions - blue badge holders, emergency vehicles and the like. Busses too, but even those would benefit since there would be virtually zero other traffic to contend with. Delivery drivers could be allowed only outside of peak hours (before 8am, let’s say)

Just the other day in my area, a driver was speeding at 40mph in a 20mph main road, and careened around a corner and hit another car and crushed 3 pedestrians agains the shopfront he ran them into. The paramedics had to literally salt the road to prevent the bloodstains from soaking in. 

I don’t  mean to be graphic, but this is the reality of living in a city congested with cars. 

So why not make it virtually impossible to drive one unless for the aforementioned exceptional circumstances?

Why keep allowing cars to take the piss?

EDIT: pedestrianisation would likely cause an economic boom amongst small businesses in those areas it was implemented as your footfall would be so much higher 

EDIT: yes, i’m fully aware this will either get downvoted to hell or become one of the most “controversial” posts on this subreddit - but i’ll steel man this position till the cows come home

post,Pushed my motorcycle through a Hackney LTN — engine off. Still fined £130. Is this legit?,2025-04-10 18:30:55,"Hey all,

I got fined in Hackney for entering an LTN zone on Richmond Road with my motorcycle. But here's the thing — **my engine was off and I was physically pushing the bike**, not riding it.

I challenged it, but Hackney rejected my appeal saying:

post,Tutorial for LTN-like trains in vanilla,2025-05-07 15:54:54,"When starting SA, I was actually concerned LTN is discontinued (now it's already 2.0 ready) so I was looking for alternatives, tried few and Railway Logistics Dispatcher seemed to be promising. Eventually, I started vanilla for achievements and was all the time thinking how to do train stuff without mods. And here we are. It's possible to set up your train network only with interrupts. Totally generalized trains, only two types (for cargo and fluids). No radars, nor waits or advanced wiring. Just interrupts. And I would say it's even more effective since these mods usually uses depot station as the train's home and only updates its route when there.

Aside of common refuel, there is need for three different interrupts: Load, Unload and Depot if train is not needed.

**Setup:**

There are multiple ways how to achieve this, but let's have ALL stations that supply something to be named same name - 'Supply""/'Fluid Supply'. (If you want to identify stations or factory, you can use map tags). Let's unify ALL requesters as '\[resource icon\] Unload'. You can ofc differ station names by expected train sizes and categorize your trains accordingly. In this example, only one train size (2+4) is used. Set all station limits to 1, unless you are using waiting tracks.

[Station names with map tag](https://preview.redd.it/tlepdn0l1dze1.png?width=401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e94d103ababd6baeca63e9ee0646210de3e42a7c)

**Loading trains:**

I guess this should be pretty straightforward. If the train is empty, go to supply station and wait until full.

[Loading interrupt](https://preview.redd.it/uc2ct1cc2dze1.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6db9002b4df99c500e5708a7e8f7c9aab695ff36)

Note: You need to recreate another interrupt for fluid trains because different station name.

**Unloading trains:**

Unloading is where stuff starts to be funny. Since the train is full after loading interrupt finished, we need to check cargo type and properly select unloading station accepting loaded items. To achieve this, you'll need to set a condition with exact cargo that contains a wildcard item parameter, which is then properly propagated to a target station. You'll need to write this station name manually. Wait condition is clearly waiting for the train to be empty.

[Unloading interrupt](https://preview.redd.it/xfrqflo1qdze1.png?width=442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32a0367c5b4f3c4879ed92dce017788771099d03)

Note: You need to create another interrupt for fluid trains with wildcard fluid icon.

What will happen? When the train is full, item parameter (icon) is loaded and propagated to the target station name. The train will try to find the closest one with proper name and if there is no available, it will wait in supply station until any will be free to accept loaded cargo.

**Depot:**

Since now fine, basically you'll start filling your network with trains, but it will get eventually clogged because trains that unloaded their cargo want to go to stations supplying cargo which are occupied by trains blocked by occupied unloading stations. So, to resolve this deadlock, we want the train that doesn't have a proper target loading station to park it in the depot until it has somewhere to go.

So, firstly, setup some depot parking like this and don't forget to set trains limit to 1 for each depot station.

[Depot](https://preview.redd.it/2uuac7il4dze1.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40a342416fcd0debd461eec62cc21a1dbfe6335e)

For depot interrupt, we want to trigger it when target station is not available, and we want to trigger it only for empty trains since full has to wait in loading station otherwise your depot will be flooded with full trains and clogging whole network. Target will be depot without any waiting condition. This will lead into instantly triggering the loading interrupt after arriving into depot. Which will retrigger to depot if there is still nothing to do and since it's already sitting in depot and trains always chose the closest station, it won't do anything, just sit, and wait in the loop until some supply station becomes available.

Important: don't forget to tick checkbox allowing interrupting other interrupts.

[Depot interrupt](https://preview.redd.it/1couo6zq5dze1.png?width=435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=303fdb2f42ff1e7558a87baf6545b146adf173eb)

Note: Set some basic, e.g. 5-10s wait if having like 100+ trains to avoid constantly looping in depot&lt;&gt;load interrupts.

**Refueling tips:**

It should be easy for you to create this interrupt by yourself, but here are some optimization tips:

\- Set condition to fuel less AND empty cargo. Because if you don't tick the empty cargo, your train might get refueled full, and if target unloading will be occupied and since depot condition is only for empty trains, your train will be stuck in refueling station blocking others.

\- Set condition to fuel wildcard and set it like &lt;30. This allows you to have multiple refuel stations (useful for bigger networks) and mixed fuel types (wood/coal/solid/rocket).

\- Don't set target condition to full fuel if you use mixed fuels because obviously you will never fill those locomotives.

\- If transitioning to nuclear fuel, stop using wildcard and set condition to like nuclear fuel &lt; 2. Replace all your refuel stations with nuclear fuel and make there unloading chest for each locomotive that takes out of them everything that is no nuclear fuel.

\- Don't forget to tick interrupting for interrupts checkbox.

**Optimization tip for lowering amount of trains in the network:**

You might have noticed on the first screenshot that my unloading stations are red. They are red because they are disabled by wiring. What am I doing is disabling stations when trains cannot be unloaded. Why? Because it doesn't make sense having train sitting in supply and requester stations, so basically the idea is to limit amount of trains and overall logistics. How am I doing this? Connect all chests in requester station to train stop, calculate chests capacity, deduct train capacity and set stop to be enabled when under threshold. In this example, there are 4 wagons, each handled by 4 chests. So, chest capacity is 48 stacks by 50 (for ores) by 4 chests by 4 wagons, totalling in 38400 resources. Train capacity is then 40 stacks by 50 by 4 wagons, totalling in 8000. So, a train could properly unload if there are less than 30400 resources in the station. I've rounded down and using 30/60/120K for different stack sizes. It's kind of annoying, but since you start doing that, copy/paste eases the whole process. Also, for this, unloading cargo wagons needs to be properly balanced.

[Train stop wiring setup](https://preview.redd.it/tew363rd6dze1.png?width=193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2225b1596a5685fdbc518ebfa97506ac9aa9ef5f)

Same way, you might optimize requesters, either by enabling them or with some logic, set the number of allowed trains by remaining space in chests so they are able to fully unload. However, my experience showed, that in such case, you will still need specific amount of trains, but since they will be blocked either in loading stations or depots, you will never know the exact number. This might lead into situation that when factory production peaks, as trains prefers closest stations, they might supply only specific materials while others will be in deficiency. When not using any wires, all you need to check is that there is simply one train (per type) sitting in depot, since all loading and unloading stations should be always occupied. This way, you should always know when to add more trains.",65.0,https://www.reddit.com/search.json/r/factorio/comments/1kgxyee/tutorial_for_ltnlike_trains_in_vanilla/,LTN,,No

The reason why I tried to work without LTN were many of times when damn trains returned to depots with cargo left and then ruined the whole production.

It took me a long time, but I've made a station that works properly and requests as many trains as needed (valid mainly for big distances) and doesn't make them leave the station with something in cargo. Same with providers and guys, if you want me to make a tutorial, please let me know. The best in it is that this blueprint works for trains with multiple wagons and can be expanded to as many wagons as you need.

post,Struggling to scale our vanilla LTN-style train network (wagon length + tile space issue),2025-10-24 17:16:43,"Hey everyone,

https://preview.redd.it/hfyzyrf0t2xf1.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d18de9a235e932bb381c897c56befc1334aa7959

me and my friend have been building a rail-based city in Factorio, and our entire logistics system runs on a vanilla version of LTN using the “new” interrupt system. Basically, trains automatically detect which resource is needed in the network, and the first available train goes to a Provider station, then unloads at a Requester station. It’s been working super smoothly so far… but now we’ve hit a couple of big issues.



Problem #1: Handling different train lengthsIf a station needs a train with 2+ wagons, we can’t find a way to communicate that to the depot system. Is there any way to send a signal through the network that says, “I need a train with two (or more) wagons”? We want to keep things scalable, so manually assigning trains or setting up fixed routes isn’t really an option.

Our current workaround. We made all trains 4 wagons long. Then we set up a system that communicates esource demand per wagon. e.g.1 wagon = 4k iron plates; 2 wagons = 8k etc. That way, every station can technically host a 4-wagon train, but depending on how the station is configured, it will only load/unload 1–4 wagons. For example: A plastic provider/requester usually handles just 1 wagon (since demand never gets too high). Iron plate stations often handle 3–4 wagons This works fine logically, but…

https://preview.redd.it/evr9aci4t2xf1.png?width=833&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=143d07609192efa236bf39cdd7b74f6caf275cd3



Problem #2 — Space and tile layout: Now every station needs to fit a 4-wagon train. We’re using 100x100 tiles, and we just can’t find a way to fit all the stations (including train stackers) within that area.Even worse, for tiles where multiple resources are both produced and requested (4–5 resources per tile), there’s simply no way to fit everything — loaders, unloaders, stackers, and all — without spilling onto the main rail lines.

[OLD System](https://preview.redd.it/ntx87occt2xf1.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9f17252429722e916a9ed502d614a1e45c6687d)

Our question is: How can we design a layout that fits loading/unloading rails and a small stacker area within a 100x100 tile, without blocking the main network?
